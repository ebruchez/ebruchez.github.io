In this post, I describe the continuation of the cleaning of the machine. This is still a work in progress as of October 2021.</p><h2 id="the-ribbon-mechanism">The ribbon mechanism</h2><p>The ribbon mechanism was very dirty and at first I couldn’t remove the ribbon cartridge.</p><figure> <img src="/assets/posts/ibm-memory-typewriter/2x/IMG_8378.jpg" alt="Filth" /><figcaption>Filth</figcaption></figure><p>Luckily the service manual has detailed instruction about the ribbon mechansim and how things fit together.</p><figure> <img src="/assets/posts/ibm-memory-typewriter/2x/ribbon-mechanism-removal.jpg" alt="Ribbon mechanism removal instructions" /><figcaption>Ribbon mechanism removal instructions</figcaption></figure><p>Still, I had to pull out the cartridge in an unorthodox way! It turned out that the swing arm on the ribbon mechanism was the part causing problems. It was completely stuck. I decided to take everything apart for in-depth cleaning.</p><figure> <img src="/assets/posts/ibm-memory-typewriter/2x/IMG_8382.jpg" alt="Cleaning the ribbon mechanism" /><figcaption>Cleaning the ribbon mechanism</figcaption></figure><p>The parts came out really clean.</p><figure> <img src="/assets/posts/ibm-memory-typewriter/2x/IMG_8416.jpg" alt="The ribbon mechanism after cleaning" /><figcaption>The ribbon mechanism after cleaning</figcaption></figure><p>Unlike the regular Selectric, this ribbon mechanism also has a a reed switch and magnet to detect the end of the ribbon! Here is what the manual says:</p><blockquote><p>The end of ribbon feature stops playout prior to the end of the ribbon. When the machine stops, the operator has the option of changing the ribbon at that time or resuming playout one line at a time until the copy is complete or the end of the ribbon is reached. When the end of ribbon mechanism is active, the machine will stop each time a carrier return is read.</p><p>The end of ribbon mechanism incorporates a sensor which senses the amount of ribbon remaining on the supply spool inside the ribbon cartridge. Tue sensor operates through a slot in the bottom of the ribbon cartridge and is held down (inactive) by the unused ribbon on the supply spool. When the diameter of the ribbon on the supply spool falls below a certain point, the sensor will snap up into its active position. In this position, the lower extension of the sensor, which has a magnet attached to it, will rotate against a reed switch circuit board, causing the switch to close. With the switch closed, the machine will operate in the LINE mode and will stop whenever a carrier return code is read from the card.</p></blockquote><p>At first I thought that this was over-engineered, but in fact this makes sense for a machine that is able to print an entire page out of memory.</p><figure> <img src="/assets/posts/ibm-memory-typewriter/2x/IMG_8417.jpg" alt="The &quot;ribbon end&quot; reed switch and magnet" /><figcaption>The "ribbon end" reed switch and magnet</figcaption></figure><p>The type element had a broken tab, which is 100% certain to happen on elements with the metal hinge.

I was advised to clean things in place. I put rags to absorb liquids just in case, as I really don’t want liquids to reach the planar, and I used mineral spirits and a toothbrush to loosen grime and grease. I used compressed air to get the stuff out. It’s a slow and tiresome process, which I did with a headlight to see what I was doing. Here is an example of what I have to deal with.</p><figure> <img src="/assets/posts/ibm-memory-typewriter/2x/IMG_8426.jpg" alt="Gunk" /><figcaption>Gunk</figcaption></figure><p>Halfway through the process, I tried the machine again.
