Unlike other computers of the days, it never got to have many peripherals. However, Steve Wozniak did design an audio cassette adapter (known simply as the “ACI”), which allowed the Apple-1 to save and load programs and data to and from standard audio cassettes. This was the Apple-1’s “storage” in modern parlance — that is, some kind of persistent memory.</p><p>The idea of using an audio recorder to keep computer data is simple: you encode each bit of data as a short sound. Specifically, in this case, according to the ACI manual:</p><blockquote><p>a 1 kHz cycle (representing a ‘one’ data bit) or a 2 kHz cycle (representing a ‘zero’ data bit)</p></blockquote><p>It’s a miracle that something this simple worked, especially with an electronic circuit containing only four chips in addition to the PROMs. But it did, with some caveats about reliability.</p><p>The ACI fits into the single expansion slot of the Apple-1. This still leaves the edge connector available for other extensions, but it is a reminder that the Apple-1 had relatively few extension capabilities by default, in particular compared to the later Apple II, which had eight expansion slots.</p><h2 id="the-pcb">The PCB</h2><p>I ordered the PCB from Mike Newton (AKA Mike Ng). It wasn’t as cheap as if I had one made directly from a PCB manufacturer, but it looks closer to the original. In fact, it is a beautiful PCB.</p><figure> <img src="/assets/posts/apple1/2x/IMG_3454.jpg" alt="The ACI reproduction PCB" /><figcaption>The ACI reproduction PCB</figcaption></figure><p>The PCB came not only with programmed PROMs, but also with a few spare components.</p><figure> <img src="/assets/posts/apple1/2x/IMG_3456.jpg" alt="The extra components" /><figcaption>The extra components</figcaption></figure><p>I happened to already have most of the components, but I appreciated them anyway.</p><h2 id="components">Components</h2><p>I had already acquired most of the components for the ACI while I was planning the acquisition of the <a href="../apple-1-reproduction-part-1-components/">components for the main board</a>. There is not that much:</p><div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Component<th>Comment<tbody><tr><td>PROMs<td>I had two sets, one from Mike and one from Germany.<tr><td>IC sockets<td>I used machined sockets, as I did for the Apple-1 main board.<tr><td>74 series chips<td>Unlike those on the main board, these are “LS”.<tr><td>LM311 op amp<td> <tr><td>2 transistors<td>The 2N3904 is a proven modern replacement for MPS3704.<tr><td>LED<td>I went with the 3 mm size instead of the 5 mm.

However, there is more to it. Here are some resources that I consulted before proceeding with the build:</p><ul><li>Mike Willegal’s <a href="http://www.myapplecomputer.net/docs/ACIBuildGuide.pdf">Mimeo Cassette Interface Assembly and Operations Guide</a><li>On AppleFritter:<ul><li><a href="https://www.applefritter.com/content/uncle-bernies-improved-apple-1-cassette-interface">UNCLE BERNIE’S IMPROVED APPLE-1 CASSETTE INTERFACE</a><li><a href="https://www.applefritter.com/content/which-aci-improvements-do-exist-and-work">Which ACI improvements do exist (and work) ?</a></ul><li>San Bergmans’s <a href="https://www.sbprojects.net/projects/apple1/aci.php">page about the Apple-1 Cassette Interface</a></ul><h3 id="input-capacitor">Input capacitor</h3><p>Everybody agrees that a specific change needs to be made compared with the original. This recommendation was made by Mike Willegal’s in particular. It consists in increasing the value of the input coupling capacitor from 10 nF to 100 nF. The 10 nF value just seems to have been a bad design choice back in the days:</p><ul><li>Mike Willegal: “increase the value of the input coupling capacitor”<li>Uncle Bernie: “It is absolutely necessary that you put the 100nF input capacitor mod in, as suggested by Mike Willegal.”</ul><h3 id="decoupling-capacitors">Decoupling capacitors</h3><p>This might be minor, but I decided to add two decoupling capacitors for the PROMs. This is not strictly necessary, but it won’t hurt, and I am now confident about mounting capacitors into IC sockets.</p><figure> <img src="/assets/posts/apple1/2x/IMG_5826.jpg" alt="The decoupling capacitors for the PROMs" /><figcaption>The decoupling capacitors for the PROMs</figcaption></figure><h3 id="10-kω-resistors">10 kΩ resistors</h3><p>The original ACI called for 1% 10 kΩ resistors. But Uncle Bernie commented:</p><blockquote><p>The 1% spec probably was an attempt by Woz to make the ACI work better. The attempt failed. No amount of matching in these resistors can undo the catastrophic AC impedance mismatch which suddenly occurs at the comparator inputs when the cassette recorder is plugged in.</p></blockquote><p>And:</p><blockquote><p>But according to my opinion, it is not necessary to use 1% tolerated resistors for the four 10K ones. You can use 5% and 10% resistors (which I tried out). With 20% resistors (old carbon composition resistors perhaps) I’d recommend you to measure a bunch of them and pick four which come closest to each other. This “closeness” of the values among these four resistors (electronic professionals call this “matching”) most likely is the reason why Woz specified 1% tolerances.</p></blockquote><p>So I just used my large batch of Allen Bradley 10 kΩ resistors. I measured a few and picked four that were close, understanding that this was probably not necessary, but there was no real drawback going through this just in case.</p><figure> <img src="/assets/posts/apple1/2x/IMG_5827.jpg" alt="Partial assembly" /><figcaption>Partial assembly</figcaption></figure><h3 id="gen1-or-gen2">Gen1 or Gen2?</h3><p>Uncle Bernie worked on an improved version of the ACI, which he calls “Gen2.” I looked into it, but unfortunately PCBs for it are not in the open and not available anymore from Mike Newton. So I decided to go with the “Gen1” version, which is the original version, but with some improvements.</p><p>Uncle Bernie suggested two types of ACI improvements:</p><ol><li>A fix for the volume indicator, which uses the unused half of the 74LS74.<li>The use of larger PROMs, with improved software.</ol><p>I decided to implement the first one, but not the second one, as I don’t have the larger PROMs anyway.</p><p>The audio volume fix requires cutting two traces on the ACI board, and adding some wires as well as a capacitor. Uncle Bernie suggested mounting that capacitor within an IC socket, but since the wire needs to go out, it is a little tricky. I decided to leave the IC socket unmodified, and to place the capacitor on the bottom of the board. I carefully bent the legs of the capacitor, and used heat shrink tubing to protect the legs and wires. This is more visible than Uncle Bernie’s solution, but a little less tricky to implement. However, I am pretty happy with how the small wires to the jacks came up!</p><figure> <img src="/assets/posts/apple1/2x/IMG_5844.jpg" alt="The volume indicator fix on the ACI" /><figcaption>The volume indicator fix on the ACI</figcaption></figure><p>In summary, compared to the original ACI, the list of changes is as follows:</p><ul><li>use the 100 nF input coupling capacitor mod<li>add two decoupling capacitors for the PROMs<li>for the volume indicator fix<ul><li>cut two traces on the ACI board<li>replace the 100 kΩ resistor with a 5.1 MΩ resistor<li>add the 1 nF capacitor<li>add the necessary wires</ul></ul><p>I didn’t have Allen Bradley resistors except for the 10 kΩ ones, so I used regular resistors, which I soldered a little more lightly so I could replace them later. In fact, I quickly got and soldered Allen Bradley 100 Ω resistors.</p><p>Here is the fully assembled ACI board without the ICs.</p><figure> <img src="/assets/posts/apple1/2x/IMG_5836.jpg" alt="The fully assembled ACI board" /><figcaption>The fully assembled ACI board</figcaption></figure><p>Note that I mounted the 3 mm LED bent, as I think most ACIs were made.</p><figure> <img src="/assets/posts/apple1/2x/IMG_6360.jpg" alt="100 Ω resistor and LED" /><figcaption>100 Ω resistor and LED</figcaption></figure><p>And here is the fully assembled board with the ICs mounted in their sockets.</p><figure> <img src="/assets/posts/apple1/2x/IMG_6359.jpg" alt="The ACI board with the 100 Ω resistors" /><figcaption>The ACI board with the 100 Ω resistors</figcaption></figure><h2 id="installing-the-aci">Installing the ACI</h2><p>The first thing to be careful about here is the orientation, facing outward.</p><figure> <img src="/assets/posts/apple1/2x/IMG_5882.jpg" alt="The ACI installed in the Apple-1" /><figcaption>The ACI installed in the Apple-1</figcaption></figure><p>Here is the view from the other side.

So installed individual machined IC socket pins in the memory map section, so I could easily jumper them.

So I decided to use a real tape recorder. Apple recommended a Panasonic recorder. Mike Willegal <a href="https://www.willegal.net/appleii/aci.htm">says</a> it was a Panasonic RQ2102 and, “believe it or not, they are still available from Panasonic.” I am not sure they are actually still made in 2025, but I bought a used one on ShopGoodwill, for just over $20 shipped.</p><figure> <img src="/assets/posts/apple1/2x/IMG_6459.jpg" alt="The Panasonic RQ-2102 tape recorder" /><figcaption>The Panasonic RQ-2102 tape recorder</figcaption></figure><p>It turned out to be in clean and almost pristine condition.</p><figure> <img src="/assets/posts/apple1/2x/IMG_6352.jpg" alt="The inside of the Panasonic RQ-2102 tape recorder" /><figcaption>The inside of the Panasonic RQ-2102 tape recorder</figcaption></figure><p>It was manufactured in 2012.</p><figure> <img src="/assets/posts/apple1/2x/IMG_6353.jpg" alt="The Panasonic RQ-2102 tape recorder's manufacturing date" /><figcaption>The Panasonic RQ-2102 tape recorder's manufacturing date</figcaption></figure><p>I plugged both the input and the output of the ACI into the tape recorder, as intended. The ACI has a 3.5mm female audio jack for input, and a 3.5mm female audio jack for output, and the tape recorder has corresponding female jacks as well.</p><p>I wanted to load BASIC from tape, as a user would have done in the 1970s. There are a few ways to get a tape with BASIC on it.</p><ol><li>You can obtain a tape with the BASIC program already on it.<li>You can make a tape yourself.</ol><p>I chose the second option. But how? I could simply play the audio from my laptop and record it to the tape recorder. Instead, I did it the harder way: I reloaded BASIC from the computer into the Apple-1 as done above, and then saved it to tape from the Apple-1. I used the following command:</p><div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><code><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="rouge-gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1
2
</pre><td class="rouge-code"><pre>C100R
E000.EFFFW
</pre></table></code></div></div><p>As simple as that! The trailing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">W</code> means “write,” and the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">E000.EFFF</code> means “read from memory from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">E000</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">EFFF</code>.” I now had a tape with BASIC on it!</p><figure> <img src="/assets/posts/apple1/2x/IMG_6463.jpg" alt="BASIC saved to tape" /><figcaption>BASIC saved to tape</figcaption></figure><p>The next step was to write a simple BASIC program, save it to tape, and then reload it. I used a separate tape, to avoid mistakenly overwriting my BASIC tape. In the BASIC manual, Apple documented how to do this:</p><ul><li>write your program in BASIC<li>press RESET to exit BASIC<li>run the ACI program with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C100R</code><li>type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">4A.00FFW800.FFFW</code><li>set the tape recorder to “record”<li>press “RETURN” to start writing to the tape</ul><figure> <img src="/assets/posts/apple1/2x/IMG_6376.jpg" alt="Saving a program to tape" /><figcaption>Saving a program to tape</figcaption></figure><p>To read the program back, you run the ACI program again, type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">4A.00FFR800.FFFR</code>, set the tape recorder to “play,” and press return on the computer. Then you reenter BASIC not with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">E000R</code> as usual, but with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">E2B3R</code>. This enters BASIC without clearing the program memory. From there, it is as if you had just typed in the program read from tape.</p><p>It would be fun to do the same for my C program. You would need to do something similar to what is done with BASIC:</p><ul><li>identity the memory regions needed by the program<li>add an entry point which doesn’t re-initializes the program’s working memory, in particular the heap</ul><p>It’s probably an obvious thing to say, but the ACI does not remote-control the tape recorder, so you need to press the “play” or “record” buttons at appropriate times, as well as rewind the tape yourself. This is unlike big iron tape drives for the mainframes and minicomputers of the time, which were controlled by the computer.</p><figure> <img src="/assets/posts/apple1/2x/ibm-2401.jpg" alt="IBM 2401 System/360 tape drives" /><figcaption>IBM 2401 System/360 tape drives</figcaption></figure><p><em>Photo credit: <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=8725007">Erik Pitti, San Diego, CA, USA</a></em></p><h2 id="manual">Manual</h2><p>Apple made a separate small manual for the ACI.

The display was not showing what it was supposed to show, as if it didn’t synchronize. I tried a couple of monitors, cables, and eventually zeroed in on the 74175, a quad D-type flip-flop, made in 1973: swapping it for another chip, the issue was resolved. I tested the 74175 in my chip tester, and it showed as failed there too, unsurprisingly. Curiously, the chip must somehow have gone bad between the last time I had the Apple-1 on, a few months ago, and now.</p><figure> <img src="/assets/posts/apple1/2x/IMG_5720.jpg" alt="The failed 74175" /><figcaption>The failed 74175</figcaption></figure><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>I now have a fully functional Apple-1 reproduction, with a working ACI and tape recorder. The only thing missing from this setup would be a case. I am not yet sure if I will build one, although I have collected lots of pictures from existing cases, vintage and modern. If I do, I will plan to write a follow-up post.</p><hr /></div><div class="post-tail-wrapper text-muted"><div class="post-meta mb-3"> <i class="far fa-folder-open fa-fw mr-1"></i> <a href='/categories/technology/'>Technology</a></div><div class="post-tail-bottom d-flex justify-content-between align-items-center mt-3 pt-5 pb-2"><div class="share-wrapper"> <span class="share-label text-muted mr-1">Share</span> <span class="share-icons"> <i class="fa-fw fas fa-link small" onclick="copyLink()" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Copy link"></i> </span></div></div></div></div></div><div id="panel-wrapper" class="col-xl-3 pl-2 text-muted topbar-down"><div class="access"><div id="access-lastmod" class="post"> <span>Recent Updates</span><ul class="post-content pl-0 pb-1 ml-1 mt-2"><li><a href="/posts/vail-resorts-epic-coverage-declined/">Beware of Vail Resorts' Epic Coverage</a><li><a href="/posts/restoring-ibm-memory-typewriter-1/">Restoring an IBM Memory Typewriter - Part 1</a><li><a href="/posts/apple-1-reproduction-part-7-audio-cassette-adapter/">Building an Apple-1 Reproduction in 2024/2025 - Part 7: The Audio Cassette Adapter</a><li><a href="/posts/apple-1-reproduction-part-6-c-programming/">Building an Apple-1 Reproduction in 2024/2025 - Part 6: C Programming</a><li><a href="/posts/apple-1-reproduction-part-3-retro-chip-tester/">Building an Apple-1 Reproduction in 2024 - Part 3: The Retro Chip Tester</a></ul></div></div><script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/afeld/bootstrap-toc@1.0.1/dist/bootstrap-toc.min.js"></script><div id="toc-wrapper" class="pl-0 pr-4 mb-5"> <span class="pl-3 pt-2 mb-2">Contents</span><nav id="toc" data-toggle="toc"></nav></div></div></div><div class="row"><div class="col-12 col-lg-11 col-xl-8"><div id="post-extend-wrapper" class="pl-1 pr-1 pl-sm-2 pr-sm-2 pl-md-4 pr-md-4"><div id="related-posts" class="mt-5 mb-2 mb-sm-4"><h3 class="pt-2 mt-1 mb-4 ml-1" data-toc-skip>Further Reading</h3><div class="card-deck mb-4"><div class="card"> <a href="/posts/ibm-mt-sc-2/"><div class="card-body"> <span class="timeago small" > Jul 3, 2024 <i class="unloaded">2024-07-03T14:25:00-07:00</i> </span><h3 class="pt-0 mt-1 mb-3" data-toc-skip>The IBM Magnetic Tape Selectric Composer - Part 2</h3><div class="text-muted small"><p> The IBM Magnetic Tape Selectric Composer (MT/SC) Introduction This is part 2 of a two-part post.
