On the Apple-1, it is split into two parts:</p><ul><li><em>Separate from the main board:</em> two transformers, fuse, switch, wiring to the mains and to the main board.<li><em>On the main board:</em> rectifier diodes, capacitors, and regulators.</ul><p>You can see these two parts represented in the following schematics:</p><figure> <img src="/assets/posts/apple1/2x/apple-1-power-supply-schematics.jpg" alt="Apple-1 power supply schematics" /><figcaption>Apple-1 power supply schematics</figcaption></figure><p><em>Credit: Apple-1 schematics redrawn by Armin Hierstetter, colorized by myself.</em></p><p>The main board features a 6-pin Molex connector, identified by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">J1</code>, to which the output of the transformers is connected.</p><p>On many original Apple-1s, you can see the two transformers in the open, simply mounted on a separate wooden base. There are even some iconic photos of Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs with the Apple-1, where you can see the transformers on such a base.</p><figure> <img src="/assets/posts/apple1/2x/woz-jobs-apple1.jpg" alt="Woz and Steve Jobs with the Apple-1" width="75%" /><figcaption>Woz and Steve Jobs with the Apple-1</figcaption></figure><h2 id="modern-approaches">Modern approaches</h2><p>In 2024, you could instead use a modern power supply. People have adapted, in particular, MEAN WELL power supplies. This is good because:</p><ul><li>it is more power-efficient;<li>it can be safer as the power supply is fully enclosed;<li>it is smaller and lighter.</ul><p>I have seen online two beautiful examples of such power supplies, including one by Armin in Germany, and one by Arunas in Lithuania. I don’t rule out that I will try something like this in the future.</p><h2 id="choice-of-enclosure">Choice of enclosure</h2><p>I have to recognize that the transformers on a wooden board have some appeal! But for now, I wanted to go with the original transformers. However, for practical and safety reasons, I decided that I wanted to enclose the transformers and associated hardware.</p><p>I came across those inexpensive but fairly pretty blue metal (with white plastic parts) cases. The case has front and back panels, a removable top panel, vents on the left and right side, and rubber feet. This one was $12.44 shipped from AliExpress. Note that while it comes with the screws to attach the top panel, it doesn’t come with screws to attach the front and back panel and you have to provide those yourself.</p><figure> <img src="/assets/posts/apple1/2x/blue-box.jpg" alt="The blue case from marketing material" /><figcaption>The blue case from marketing material</figcaption></figure><p>My plan was to mount my transformers inside, but also to use the opportunity to include some enhancements sometimes recommended by the Apple-1 community:</p><ul><li>secondary fuses<li>secondary LED indicators</ul><p>The secondary fuses are not present in the Apple-1 schematics, but they are an obvious protection in case of serious problem. They are in particular recommended by Uncle Bernie on the AppleFritter forums.</p><p>The LED indicators are not present in the schematics either, but I think they are pretty cool, and they indicate that the power supply is on and working and that the fuses have not blown up.</p><h2 id="transformers">Transformers</h2><p>As mentioned in <a href="../apple-1-reproduction-part-1-components/">Part 1</a>, I obtained two Triad Magnetics transformers from Mouser.</p><ul><li>The large transformer is a Triad F-31X which outputs 10 V up to 3.0 A.<li>The small transformer is a Triad F-40X which outputs 26.8 V up to 1.0 A, with a center tap.</ul><p>These are brand new, made in Philadelphia (the stickers say “Made in PHL”).</p><figure> <img src="/assets/posts/apple1/2x/IMG_1230.jpg" alt="Transformers and other items from Mouser" /><figcaption>Transformers and other items from Mouser</figcaption></figure><p>The original Apple-1 manual actually recommends Stancor or Triad transformers, so this is as good as it gets.</p><figure> <img src="/assets/posts/apple1/2x/power-supplies-requirements.jpg" alt="Transformer requirements from the Apple-1 manual" /><figcaption>Transformer requirements from the Apple-1 manual</figcaption></figure><h2 id="design-and-prototyping">Design and prototyping</h2><p>I started with a very crud wiring diagram, which I barely dare show here.</p><figure> <img src="/assets/posts/apple1/2x/psu-wiring-diagram.jpg" alt="Wiring diagram" width="75%" /><figcaption>Wiring diagram</figcaption></figure><p>Then I prototyped the panels in cardboard, to make sure each component would have enough clearance. Here is a view of the back with the power entry, fuse holders, and power output connector.</p><figure> <img src="/assets/posts/apple1/2x/IMG_8011.jpg" alt="Cardboard prototype" /><figcaption>Cardboard prototype</figcaption></figure><p>I planned to use DIN connectors for the output:</p><ul><li>5-pin female DIN on the chassis<li>5-pin male DIN on the cable</ul><p>The pinout would be entirely custom. Even though the Apple-1 schematics show a 6-pin connector, 5 pins are enough for the two transformers secondaries, plus one wire for the center tap, which becomes the “ground” on the Apple-1 board.</p><p>I made sure the transformers and other parts would fit without problems. I placed the transformers sideways to optimize the space.</p><figure> <img src="/assets/posts/apple1/2x/IMG_8016.jpg" alt="Fitting the transformers" /><figcaption>Fitting the transformers</figcaption></figure><h2 id="front-panel">Front panel</h2><p>I wanted to have LED indicators for the transformer secondaries. For this, you need an LED, resistor, and signal diode as the output of the transformers are AC and an LED is polarized. With this, the LEDs will blink at 60 Hz (but you will not see it unless you try to take a picture or video). I prototyped this on a breadboard first as I wanted to be sure I used adequate resistor values. Here is what I used:</p><ul><li>3 × 1N4148 diodes<li>10 V secondary: 1 × 390 Ohm resistor<li>13 V secondaries: 2 × 560 Ohm resistors</ul><p><em>UPDATE: I was asked about the reason of the presence of another diode in addition to the LED. After all, an LED is also a diode (it’s in the name: Light Emitting Diode), so even with AC, things should work. To be fair, I had seen that design with an additional diode before, and it seemed to make sense and didn’t think twice about the diode. Here is the explanation:</em></p><p><em>The LED is connected to AC so there is a reverse voltage half of the time up to about <strong>10 V</strong> or <strong>13 V</strong>. The datasheet for standard LEDs mention a max reverse voltage supported of <strong>5 V</strong>, so without doing anything more we would be exceeding that spec. Using a signal diode, we protect the LED against such excessive reverse voltage. A 1N4148 for example support around 100 V reverse voltage, so it will block in the reverse direction without any problem. I imagine that in practice, an LED might support a higher reverse voltage than 5 V, and things might still work without an extra diode, but based on the datasheet values, extra protection for the LED is warranted.</em></p><figure> <img src="/assets/posts/apple1/2x/IMG_8037.jpg" alt="LED indicator prototype" /><figcaption>LED indicator prototype</figcaption></figure><p>After drilling holes for the LEDs, I mounted them on the front panel with holders. I soldered the resistors and diodes directly on the LED pins.</p><figure> <img src="/assets/posts/apple1/2x/IMG_8053.jpg" alt="LED indicators" /><figcaption>LED indicators</figcaption></figure><p>I used heat shrink tubing to protect the connections.</p><figure> <img src="/assets/posts/apple1/2x/IMG_8060.jpg" alt="Heat shrink tubing" /><figcaption>Heat shrink tubing</figcaption></figure><p>Here I am testing that the LEDs work.</p><figure> <img src="/assets/posts/apple1/2x/IMG_8072.jpg" alt="Testing the LEDs" /><figcaption>Testing the LEDs</figcaption></figure><p>Here is the result from the front after screwing the front panel.</p><figure> <img src="/assets/posts/apple1/2x/IMG_8185.jpg" alt="Front panel" /><figcaption>Front panel</figcaption></figure><h2 id="back-panel">Back panel</h2><p>For space reasons I had to use the small and common 20 mm × 5 mm fuses, as well as the matching holders, instead of the larger 3AG fuses that one might have used if just mounting the transformers on a wooden board. The use of these holders allows you to easily change the fuses from the outside of the case. The space inside the box is very limited anyway, and this seems to be a better design. Of course, one hopes that you will never have to actually change a blown fuse as that would indicate a serious problem happened! I followed advice on Apple-1 forums to use:</p><ul><li>1 × 0.5 A fuse for the primary, which fits in the power entry assembly<li>3 × fuses for the secondaries<ul><li>2 × 1 A slow blow for the small transformer that will feed the -12 V/-5 V and +12 V supplies on the board<li>1 × 3 A slow blow for the large transformer that will feed the main +5 V supply on the board</ul></ul><p>I drilled/cut/filed the metal for the back panel. This was a pain as I don’t have a drill press or a good metal saw. So I used a hand drill, Dremel, and a file. But it worked out.</p><figure> <img src="/assets/posts/apple1/2x/IMG_8073.jpg" alt="Back panel with components" /><figcaption>Back panel with components</figcaption></figure><p>I then worked on the female DIN connector, but I had trouble with the specific one I had bought. It was too cheaply made and I didn’t trust the connections. Still, I tried soldering wires to it.</p><figure> <img src="/assets/posts/apple1/2x/IMG_8085.jpg" alt="DIN connector" /><figcaption>DIN connector</figcaption></figure><p>However, I decided to abandon this specific connector and to have the cable go out of the case without a connector, just through a grommet, as a temporary solution.</p><p>I assembled the Molex connector easily. The metal parts (<a href="https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/538-08-70-1031-CT">“SPOX Crimp Terminal, 18-24 AWG, Brass, Reel”</a>) need to be cut from a roll.</p><figure> <img src="/assets/posts/apple1/2x/IMG_8087.jpg" alt="Molex connector parts" /><figcaption>Molex connector parts</figcaption></figure><p>Here are the cut parts.</p><figure> <img src="/assets/posts/apple1/2x/IMG_8092.jpg" alt="Molex connector parts cut" /><figcaption>Molex connector parts cut</figcaption></figure><p>While I crimped them with small pliers, I also soldered the wires (I realize that there is possible debate about that).</p><figure> <img src="/assets/posts/apple1/2x/IMG_8095.jpg" alt="Molex connector crimped and soldered" /><figcaption>Molex connector crimped and soldered</figcaption></figure><p>Here is the female connector (<a href="https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/538-09-50-1061">“3.96mm Pitch SPOX Crimp Housing, Female, with Friction Ramp, 6 Circuits, Natural”</a>) with its six wires installed.</p><p><em>NOTE: I later removed wire #5, see further below.</em></p><figure> <img src="/assets/posts/apple1/2x/IMG_8097.jpg" alt="Molex connector with wires" /><figcaption>Molex connector with wires</figcaption></figure><p>I then used a sleeve and heat shrink tubing over the end:</p><figure> <img src="/assets/posts/apple1/2x/IMG_8196.jpg" alt="Finished connector" /><figcaption>Finished connector</figcaption></figure><p>Here is the result after screwing the back panel in place.

I decided to order a new female DIN connector from DigiKey (which costs a large multiple of the ones bought from AliExpress). And it does feel sturdier, with the pins also better laid out for soldering.</p><p>I started by updating my original cable. I removed the sleeve and the heat shrink tubing, and then I followed Uncle Bernie’s advice, and decided that I would keep only five out of the six wires. You can see the updated Molex side here.</p><figure> <img src="/assets/posts/apple1/2x/IMG_0138.jpg" alt="Molex connector updated" /><figcaption>Molex connector updated</figcaption></figure><p>Indeed, wires 5 and 6 are both “ground” and connected together on the PCB, so only one of those is needed on the cable. It seems that removing wire 5 (instead of wire 6) has the benefit that if you also remove pin 5 of the connector on the Apple-1 board, reversing the connector by mistake should not cause a short or blow up anything. However, I still have pin 5 on my board, so I better not reverse the connector in any case.<sup id="fnref:reversing"><a href="#fn:reversing" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p><p>I forgot to take pictures of the process, but I carefully placed heat shrink tubing on the wires, then the sleeve, and the plastic end of the DIN connector. You have to put the various parts in the right order or things won’t work out! I then soldered my 5 wires to the male DIN connector pins, in the same order that they are on the Apple-1 Molex connector. Soldering was the most difficult part, as my wires are 18 AWG (while 20 AWG would have worked as well), and the pins inside the connector are smaller. I did ok though, and I wrapped each solder joint with heat shrink tubing. I was then able to close everything, adjust the sleeve, and use the black shrink tubing to cover the other end, near the Molex connector, as I had done before.</p><p>Then I soldered wires to the female connector. This was much easier and more secure than with my previous cheap connector. You can see how the metal pins nicely open outward, making it easy to solder larger wires to them.</p><figure> <img src="/assets/posts/apple1/2x/IMG_0099.jpg" alt="Soldering wires" /><figcaption>Soldering wires</figcaption></figure><p>Again, I added heat shrink tubing to protect all connections. I also soldered a wire to the chassis of the DIN connector to connect to the case’s ground.</p><figure> <img src="/assets/posts/apple1/2x/IMG_0100.jpg" alt="Heat shrink tubing" /><figcaption>Heat shrink tubing</figcaption></figure><p><em>NOTE: The Apple-1 “ground” does NOT connect to the metal case or to the mains’s ground wire. It is advised not to ground the Apple-1 this way, so it remains “floating” relative to the ground.</em></p><p>I reconnected the wires inside the case, and screwed the connector to the case.</p><figure> <img src="/assets/posts/apple1/2x/IMG_0102.jpg" alt="The female DIN connector installed" /><figcaption>The female DIN connector installed</figcaption></figure><p>Here is the entire back panel, without cables connected.</p><figure> <img src="/assets/posts/apple1/2x/IMG_0126.jpg" alt="The back panel with the DIN connector" /><figcaption>The back panel with the DIN connector</figcaption></figure><p>You can see here how the output cable connects to the power supply.

I think that using a PCIe 6-pin connector would be more robust, but I don’t think there are panel-mounted connectors, so this solution would require cutting a rectangular opening in the back panel and a supporting PCB that is secured to the back or bottom panel. In the end, this would be significantly more work. The pinout would still be non-standard, as this PCIe connector is normally meant to have 3 ground pins and 3 +12 V pins.</p><figure> <img src="/assets/posts/apple1/2x/pcie-6-pin-connector.jpg" alt="PCIe 6-pin connector" width="50%" /><figcaption>PCIe 6-pin connector</figcaption></figure><p><em>Credit: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCI_Express#/media/File:PCI_Express_Power_Supply_Connector-female_PNr%C2%B00438.jpg">D-Kuru/Wikipedia</a></em></p><h2 id="small-tasks">Small tasks</h2><p>The specific power entry module I chose is meant to clip on a case panel. However, my panels are thin, and there was some clearance between the clips and the panel, making the module wobble. I considered using a spacer, but couldn’t find something of the right thickness. So I decided to use JB Weld epoxy instead: this sets really hard, with the drawback that ever removing the module will be difficult.</p><figure> <img src="/assets/posts/apple1/2x/IMG_0092.jpg" alt="Power entry module being epoxied" /><figcaption>Power entry module being epoxied</figcaption></figure><p>I also added some labels made with a label maker.
