This first Apple-branded product, designed by Steve Wozniak and marketed (and partially assembled) by Steve Jobs, sold only about 175 units of 200 made. Although it was a very simple computer, one of its novelties was that it included electronics for the keyboard and video terminal on the same board.<sup id="fnref:altair"><a href="#fn:altair" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p><figure> <img src="/assets/posts/apple1/2x/schlumberger-2-apple-1.jpg" alt="Restored Apple-1 &quot;Schlumberger #2&quot; (not mine!)" /><figcaption>Restored Apple-1 "Schlumberger #2" (not mine!)</figcaption></figure><blockquote><p>“The Apple-1 wasn’t designed as a Wozniak computer: it was a Wozniak terminal for the Arpanet - modified into a computer a little, but not really designed as a computer.” -Woz, 2023, on Steve-O’s Wild Ride!</p></blockquote><p>The Apple-1 was sold as an assembled motherboard, and did not include a standard case or accessories, except for cases made by the Byte Shop, a local computer shop that was instrumental and getting the Apple-1 started. You might have had to provide your own case, keyboard, monitor (TV), and later storage in the form of a tape player. In short, it was a machine for enthusiasts and hobbyists. Most of the surviving Apple-1s do look like hobbyist machines.</p><p>The computer was not exactly cheap at $666.66 in 1976, which is about $3,000 in 2024 dollars, but that was a bargain compared to anything else on the market. An original Apple-1 like the <a href="https://www.apple1registry.com/en/89.html">“Schlumberger #2”</a> depicted above will set you back several hundred of thousand dollars if recent auctions are any indication, the records being <a href="https://www.crainsdetroit.com/article/20141023/NEWS01/141029923/the-henry-ford-buys-early-apple-computer-for-record-905000-at">$905,000 by the Henry Ford Museum</a> in 2014, and $677,196 in 2022 for a broken prototype board (assume auction premiums on top in both cases).</p><h2 id="reproductions-and-pcbs">Reproductions and PCBs</h2><p>Since getting an original Apple-1 is out of the question for most mortals, enthusiasts have, since the 2000s, made reproductions,<sup id="fnref:reproductions"><a href="#fn:reproductions" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> including:</p><ul><li>Steve Gabaly’s Obtronix (2005)<sup id="fnref:Obtronix"><a href="#fn:Obtronix" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup><li>Mike Willegal’s <a href="https://www.willegal.net/appleii/apple1.htm">Mimeo</a> (2009)<li>Mike Newton’s (or Mike Ng’s) Newton-1 (2012)</ul><p>A huge part of the job was to recreate the PCB, and I believe that Mike Willegal was the first to do that. It appears that Mike Ng also did his own replica of the layout.</p><p>Projects that reproduce the spirit of the Apple-1 were also produced, including:</p><ul><li>Vince Briel’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replica_1">Replica 1</a> (2003)<li>Chris Davis’s more recent <a href="https://adwaterandstir.com/product/openac1/">Open AC-1</a> (out of stock as of writing)</ul><h2 id="how-i-got-started">How I got started</h2><p>Lately, Apple-1 replica PCBs (printed circuit boards) have become more commoditized, thanks to the availability of Gerber files. On a whim, in 2023, I bought a PCB on eBay from Armin in Germany, and only after the fact did I start thinking about what it would take to actually build the computer. That wasn’t the wisest strategy, and I soon realized that there is more to this project than I initially imagined!</p><p>I learned after the fact that the PCB layout is based on public Gerber files, but carefully modified by Logan Greer to match the original Apple-1 PCB closely.</p><figure> <img src="/assets/posts/apple1/2x/IMG_7095.jpg" alt="My Apple-1 Replica PCB" /><figcaption>My Apple-1 Replica PCB</figcaption></figure><p>Indeed, as of 2024, it is both easier and harder than before to build a reproduction:</p><ul><li>It is easier because the PCBs are available and information online, in forums in particular, is abundant.<li>It is harder because some of the components are harder to find or significantly more expensive, and kits<sup id="fnref:kits"><a href="#fn:kits" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> are no longer available mainly for that reason.</ul><p>As of September 2024, you can still buy fully-assembled replicas on eBay, but they are expensive, and for me that is not the point of the exercise anyway.</p><p>I should mention that there are options for the PCB: the one I bought from Armin is a fairly affordable ENIG (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroless_nickel_immersion_gold">Electroless Nickel Immersion Gold</a>) PCB, and the look of it is definitely not authentic. I realized later that for about double the amount I could have bought from him a higher-quality, silver-colored PCB. Some very knowledgeable people in online forums recommend the more pricey ones, but for better or for worse, I have decided to stay with the PCB I had. Some arguments in favor of staying with it:</p><ul><li>The edge connector plating is not going to be as robust as it could be, but it is unlikely that this connector will see many cycles of insertion/removal.<li>The ENIG process gives unmasked areas of the PCB a gold color. However, I had already decided to use machined IC sockets, which are not period-correct either, and the ones I got happened to be also gold-plated. I realize I could have gone for silver on silver as well, had I made different initial choices.</ul><p>So my build is doubling down on the “gold” look, which in itself is quite nice, although clearly inauthentic.</p><h2 id="the-quest-for-authenticity">The quest for authenticity</h2><p>One question I asked myself briefly at the start was whether I wanted the look to be as authentic as possible or not. I know that some people search (or used to search) for period-correct chips with the appropriate date codes, for example. How much money and effort you spend towards this goal is of course a matter of preference, but to me this makes the most sense if you are fixing an original Apple-1, and less sense if you are building a reproduction. Some have even gone as far as updating date codes on chips to make them look more authentic. This seems questionable to me: not only do I not understand the point of this, but there is a high potential for confusion if not deceit here.</p><p>In any case, I decided that I wouldn’t be picky and that I would only care mildly about authenticity. I am mainly interested in getting the machine to look good and to work. It is entirely acceptable for me if it is obvious that it is a reproduction. I have no intention of fooling anybody or participate in a contest. This said, I want to do a decent job, and I am selecting parts that look close to the originals when possible (like the iconic Sprague capacitors, the sinterglass diodes, some resistors and capacitors, etc.), even though that means spending a little more.</p><h2 id="the-search-for-parts">The search for parts</h2><p>In the absence of kits, finding all the parts is possibly the most daunting aspect of the project.</p><p>I started by asking questions in the <a href="https://www.applefritter.com/forum/80">Apple Fritter</a> forums to get help. Answers confirmed that the parts I thought difficult to source or pricey are indeed difficult to source or pricey!</p><p>There are several categories of parts:</p><ul><li>Available new parts that look like the original ones:<ul><li>Molex connectors, some diodes, transistors<li>blue <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprague_Electric">Sprague</a> capacitors<li>linear transformers (of the Triad brand, one of Apple’s recommended brands with Stancor)</ul><li>Easy to find modern parts that don’t look like the original parts but work:<ul><li>resistors, capacitors, diodes<li>IC sockets</ul><li>Vintage parts with some remaining sources online (eBay) or offline (electronics stores):<ul><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6502">6502 CPU</a><li>6820 PIA<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7400-series_integrated_circuits">7400-series chips</a>, disc capacitors (Unicorn Electronics, Anchor Electronics)</ul><li>Vintage parts which may or may not be available from very few sources, if not a single source online (typically eBay):<ul><li>memory chips<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shift_register">shift registers</a> (including the infamous Signetics 2519)<li>clock chips<li>PROMs</ul><li>Parts that look period-correct but can be sourced on eBay with some patience and budget:<ul><li>Allen Bradley resistors<li>A14F diodes</ul></ul><p>I have yet to add up the exact total cost, but I paid between $800 and $1,000 for the PCB and components, keeping in mind that I will end up with spare parts (extra resistors, capacitors, diodes, etc.).</p><h2 id="specific-components">Specific components</h2><h3 id="the-signetics-2519-replacement">The Signetics 2519 replacement</h3><p>The Signetics 2519 is part of the terminal section of the Apple-1. Specifically, it buffers all the characters in the current line to be displayed. This is known as “row” or “line” memory. In fact, the data sheet for the 2519 lists this as the main application for the chip.</p><figure> <img src="/assets/posts/apple1/2x/signetics2519-applications.jpg" alt="Signetics 2519 data sheet application" /><figcaption>Signetics 2519 data sheet application</figcaption></figure><p>By modern standards, this is an extraordinarily simple chip. However, it has only a single source right now (and I think that this has been the case for a very long time). With shipping, that single chip would cost me $80. I decided that this was “too much”. Luckily, smart people (Natas and Claudio AKA P-LAB) designed a replacement daughter board for the 2519. This won’t be original, but it will work, and it doesn’t stop me, should I ever get an original chip, to replace the daughter board with it:</p><ul><li><a href="https://oshwlab.com/szillat/2519-fixed">Natas’s (through-hole)</a><li><a href="https://oshwlab.com/szillat/2519-fixed-smd">Natas’s (SMD)</a><li><a href="https://p-l4b.github.io/2519/">P-LAB’s (SMD, improved)</a></ul><p>I ordered 5 SMD and 5 through-hole PCBs for a grand total of $6 shipped!</p><figure> <img src="/assets/posts/apple1/2x/IMG_0457.jpg" alt="Through-hole and SMT PCBs" /><figcaption>Through-hole and SMT PCBs</figcaption></figure><p>But then I found that the more modern HEF4557 shift-register chips were not available in either package: the DIP format is obsolete, and the SOIC-16 is replaced with a SOIC-16 Wide package! Luckily, I found a batch of 10 Philips HEF4557BT chips on eBay. If for some reason that doesn’t work I will have to order an updated version of the PCB for the SOIC-16 Wide footprint.<sup id="fnref:HEF4557BT"><a href="#fn:HEF4557BT" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup></p><figure> <img src="/assets/posts/apple1/2x/IMG_0914.jpg" alt="Philips HEF4557BT chips" /><figcaption>Philips HEF4557BT chips</figcaption></figure><p>The reason I had also ordered through-hole boards is that I thought that would be much easier to solder, and I could have switched to the SMD version later.</p><p>Now why do we need 6 “modern” chips, while there was only on original? The 2519 is a “hex” (6 inputs, 6 outputs) 40-bit shift register. The 16-pin chip has:</p><ul><li>6 inputs<li>6 outputs<li>VCC and GND (VGG)<li>clock<li>recirculate</ul><figure> <img src="/assets/posts/apple1/2x/signetics2519-package.jpg" alt="Signetics 2519 pinout" width="50%" /><figcaption>Signetics 2519 pinout</figcaption></figure><p>The replacement HEF4557BT is a slightly different beast, because its buffer size is configurable from 1 to 64 bits. This means that 6 of its pins are dedicated to this configuration. So we have:</p><ul><li>6 configuration inputs<li>2 selectable data inputs (DA and DB)<li>1 data input selector (A and /B), which can be used to recirculate bits<li>clock<li>clock enable<li>output and negated output (O and /O)<li>reset<li>VDD and VSS</ul><p>Because this needs to replace a “hex” chip, six of those HEF4557BT are needed.</p><figure> <img src="/assets/posts/apple1/2x/HEF4557B-package.jpg" alt="HEF4557BT pinout" width="50%" /><figcaption>HEF4557BT pinout</figcaption></figure><p>I had never soldered SMD components before, and I was a bit worried about it. I watched a few videos, and it turns out that it’s not as impossible as it sounded initially. Of course, on YouTube, you will find people doing the craziest things. But I started by assembling <a href="https://shop.evilmadscientist.com/productsmenu/652">The Three Fives Kit from Evil Mad Scientist</a>: here you get to solder SMD resistors and transistors, and that was good practice, even though I am still a beginner at this.</p><p>This said, I wasn’t as successful with the SOIC-16 ICs, in my estimation: observing the result under a magnifying glass, I could see that the soldering was not perfect. I tried to improve it, but my confidence in the quality of the contacts remained low. It seemed that the joints were sometimes dry, often uneven, and that the ICs were a little too high, one is clearly not perfectly aligned, etc. I will have to test the board to see if it works properly. The good part is that since there are 6 bits in parallel, if I messed up one of the ICs (and therefore bits), and if I don’t have bridges, others should work.
