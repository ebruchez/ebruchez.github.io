## Ribbon selector

TODO

For some reason I didn't think the machine had a ribbon color selector, but it does! It shares a location with the Add/Subtract toggle. It is, in fact, in the same location as the usual color selector of the Remington 10/11/12. But its shape is different: it's a wingnut!

Switching from "ADD" to "SUB" does appear to cause the ribbon selector to move, even with oiling. I am not sure how that was meant to work. But now I am thinking that this might be a feature, not a bug! When in "black" position, if you press the "SUB" key, the ribbon selector will switch to red. This means the subtracted numbers would show in red, and the added numbers in black. This cannot be a coincidence, can it? I can't be entirely positive about this, and it'd be nice to have some evidence, for example from a manual, about this.

## The decimal tabulator in action

TODO

- setting/clearing tabs
- tabulator layout

## Quick user's manual

It would be amazing to find an original manual for this machine. We only have, so far, the xxx for models 21 and 23.  In the meanwhile, we have to reverse-engineer the functionality. Luckily, it's not too hard based on the information we have.

TODO:

- positioning the totalizers
- using the decimal tabulator
- "Correction" key
- "Add/Subtract" toggle
- ribbon selector
- disengage lever
- "prevent typing" lever (name?)
