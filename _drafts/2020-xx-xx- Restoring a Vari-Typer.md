## Background

Amongst the Jim Dax collection in Sacramento was a rusty Vari-Typer.[^1] I barely glanced at it the first couple of times I saw it. But I was told that if I didn't take it, it would probably end up as scrap. So, of course, I did take it!

## So what is a Vari-Typer?

A Vari-Typer is a descendant of the Hammond typewriter. The rough history is that the Hammond company folded (pun intended) and eventually the assets were bought by Ralph Coxhead to form a new company. This gave the Hammond technology a new lease of life, that would in fact last for decades (from 1927 until 1977-78). While Varityper made vast improvement to the Hammond, some basic aspects stayed almost the same as those of an 1880s Hammond:

- a turret holding print shuttles
- a hammer hitting from the back
- a 3-bank keyboard
- the overall carriage layout with double shift

The differences (rumored to be over 3,000 eventually) were huge. The Hammond system was a skeleton upon which many new features were added, in particular:

- electrification (initially only for activating the hammer, later for the carriage return)
- full justification (since the second electric model)
- proportional spacing (called "differencial spacing" by Varityper) (on the later models)

In order of appearance, we have:

- fully mechanical Varitypers (including the Varityper Folding)
- electric Varitypers (again for the hammer)
- "automatic" justification (with the wide 22-inch carriage)
- differential spacing
- electric carriage return

xxx links to history

According to the 1940 manual, the Vari-Typer is an "electric composing type writer", and:

> The Vari-Typer is as easy to operate as an ordinary typewriter. It is the finest and most unusual writing machine in existence.
>
> The Vari-Typer is a composing Type Writer with changeable faces and spaces. It has a Universal typewriter keyboard. There are more than 300 type faces available.

xxx

also known as "cold type composing machine for use in office duplication"

"A Vari-Typer was used to compose the Instrument of Surrender signed by the Japanese on board the battleship Miss"

I already have a nice Hammond Multiplex [^2][^5] from 1919, and a nice (and fairly rare) mathematical Varityper from around 1930,[^4] which consists of a few incremental improvements over the Multiplex but already has an electric motor.[^3] I also have a Varityper FOlding from 192x.[^xxx] I also have a "parts" Multiplex which, who knows, might live again some day. xxx and another, Multiplex!

What I have learned so far is that, except for the early, smaller and fully mechanical Varityper, and maybe the first 1930-ish electric models, there is not much love for those machines among typewriter collectors. I can think of a few reasons why this is the case:

- The machines are large (or rather wide)! That makes them hard to move around and display.
- Unlike Hammonds (or early Varitypers), they have a definite "business machine" look and are not particularly pretty or elegant.
- As business machines, they are not sought after by writers.
- They are often in poor condition, as once their business utility had passed, they were put aside and not cared about.
- Finally, few people know what these machines are or how they work.

To me, that makes them interesting, even though I wouldn't go as far as saying that they are pretty.

## Other similar machines

This model of Vari-Typer is not particularly rare or collectible, although it's rarely seen in good cosmetic condition and even more rarely in working condition.

I recently saw two Vari-Typers in the History San Jose collections. They are both in better condition than mine.

I also saw one back in 2017 at a garage sale, although that machine was not officially for sale, and I was not ready to make an offer anyway. I now notice that it doesn't have the carbon ribbon system in the right-hand spool area.

Finally, here is one in superb condition in the collections of the National Museum of American History. It even has the wooden rod which you could use to insert paper and clean the paper basket (and is documented in the manual).

![Vari-Typer at the National Museum of American History](/assets/posts/vari-typer-1940/2x/national-museum-of-american-history.jpg){:standalone}{:standalone}

On the Facebook group, a few collectors have machines in various conditions.

## Dating

There is not, as far as I know, a detailed list of serial numbers with years of production for Varitypers. We know that this machine is the second electric model, which dates it to 1933 at the earliest. But it appears that this model was produced all the way to 1953, when the third electric version was introduced. So that gives us a fairly wide range.

Looking at the back of the machine, the patents list goes to 1935. So it's fair to assume that this machine was not made before 1935.

The "Care and operation of the Vari-Typer" manual (scans found online) describes this exact machine. It is dated April 1940. The manual was "composed on the Vari-Typer", by the way.

I'd be happy to find ways of narrowing the date a little further.

I find [here](https://ingeniumcanada.org/ingenium/collection-research/collection-item.php?id=2002.0614.001) the mention that "The Vari-Typer added right justification (1937)". Now this model does have right-justification. So 1937 might be a lower bound for the machine.

xxx manual 194x second version

In July 2020, I acquired an original manual, which also describes this machine, but appears to be a newer revision. It turns out I already had a downloaded version of this manual, but with rough scans. The contents appear identical except for the cover.

I also got an issue of a newsletter called "The Anvil", from January 1947, with tips for Vari-Typer owners (or rather, "Vari-Typists" as they all them).

!["The Anvil" from January 1947](/assets/posts/vari-typer-1940/2x/anvil.jpg){:standalone}{:standalone width="75%"}

## This machine

This Vari-Typer is the second generation of electric Varitypers, distinctive with its 20-inch wide carriage, carbon ribbon spool on the left, and a triangular indicator on the right called the "dial", with its "dial scale" and "dial pointer". The machine even has an electric light in the back, called the "stencil light" or "shadow light"!

This machine is able to justify columns automatically, or rather semi-automatically: you have to type every line twice. My understanding is that the first time you type it, you might go over the margin. The second time, the line is automatically compressed. How? I don't know yet!

![The dial](/assets/posts/vari-typer-1940/2x/IMG_2886.jpg){:standalone}{:standalone}

The motor features prominently in the back of the machine, and is connected via a shaft and spring connector to a spring box. The idea is that the motor rewinds the spring at the opportune time (every 13 or 17 or 19 characters, I heard and read, but I'll need to verify this empirically!).

The thing is that on a Hammond (and therefore a Varityper), the spring not only pulls the, like on most typewriters, but also activates the hammer. So I understand that this means that the spring must have more tension and, therefore, an electric motor is even more helpful. At least, that sounds like  a reasonable theory.

The Vari-Typer I got is in apparent poor condition:

- There is rust in many spots, including on the front cover.
- The paper support and guides are bent.
- The lamp post in the back is broken.
- The motor looks twisted in the back (but see updates further below!).

Now there is some beauty to this machine, in its dust, rust, and general abandonment. But the fact is that I wouldn't put it in my living room! So either it will stay in my garage, maybe for parts, or it will be restored.

![Beauty in neglect and corrosion?](/assets/posts/vari-typer-1940/2x/IMG_3413.jpg){:standalone}{:standalone}

## First steps

The first question that comes to my mind is whether the machine has any potential beyond being a parts machine. Is there is hope of making this machine ever *work* again? This means ruling out that there are serious mechanical issues with it.

The motor in the back looks really bad and needs to be inspected to see if the damage is superficial and looks worse than it is.

![The condition of the motor appeared worrying](/assets/posts/vari-typer-1940/2x/IMG_3231.jpg){:standalone}{:standalone}

Further, the machine needs to be checked, including the carriage and the main mechanical parts. The damage in the back could indicate that the machine might have been dropped, and that might have broken other parts beyond reasonable repair.

Other than that, I am not too worried about other aspects: the rusted front cover can be repainted; the bent paper support can be straightened; the lamp post replaced; etc.

So things might be better than they look, but who knows.

## The motor

I started by removing the motor. It's not a good idea to just try to plug in something that is dirty, bent out of shape, and abandoned for 60 or 70 years in dubious conditions.

I am also interested in looking into the motor because I'd like to make my 1930's Varityper work at some point, including its motor. It's good to practice first on a machine that is more common and in bad shape.

The right thing to do is therefore to remove the motor, open it up, clean it, check it, lubricate it as needed, and then try, carefully, to power it up.

Removing the motor turned out to be fairly easy: I removed machine’s big feet bar underneath so I could unscrew the little box with the electrical connections. From there, other screws allowed for removing the motor's two electrical connections.

![The wiring](/assets/posts/vari-typer-1940/2x/IMG_3242.jpg){:standalone}{:standalone}

The wiring is simple:

- the incoming power cord wires go directly to the lamp
- one of the incoming power wires goes directly to the motor
- the other incoming power wire connects to one of the spring box wires
- the other spring box wires connects to the motor

TODO: drawing!

The spring box contains a switch which opens and closes depending on the status of the spring:

- it closes the circuit when the spring needs rewinding
- it opens the circuit when the spring is wound

I also managed to remove the spring which connects the two axles on one side. A couple more screws and the motor was cleanly out.

![The extracted motor](/assets/posts/vari-typer-1940/2x/IMG_3245.jpg){:standalone}{:standalone}

I then opened the motor. I had already opened my IBM Model A Executive motor.[^6] The process is similar here: the motor's enclosure is made of two parts, and two long screws hold them together. One end came out easily. But the other didn't. I tried tapping with a punch and small hammer, fearing that I had missed something. Eentually I managed to get the stator out, but the rotor was still stuck on one side. It also didn't rotate freely. More PB Blaster, tapping, and eventually it came out without damage!

I used steel wool and even a little bit of high grit sanding on the shaft, cleaned some parts with alcohol. My goal here was to get to the point where the rotor would move freely. There is no chance of a motor like this working if it's rotor is stuck due to dirt and rust.

The bearings might be porous bronze (AKA oilite). I know this was the case on the IBM motor I cleaned. There are two little holes on each side of the motor, and the oil is supposed to seep through the porous metal to the shaft.

I used Simple Green on the enclosure. I put some slightly corroded screws into Evapo-Rust.

![The motor parts](/assets/posts/vari-typer-1940/2x/IMG_3250.jpg){:standalone}{:standalone}

I reassembled the motor and carefully connected it. I was advised to use an incandescent light bulb in series with the motor, in case there is a short in the motor, to act like a fuse. The good news is that the motor runs! But it is louder than I expected. For now, I will consider this a success. It would be good to measure the motor's rpm, which is supposed to be 4500. That's pretty fast, compared with the IBM Model A Executive motor I handled recently, which was very quiet (brushless) and speced at about 1600 rpm.

![The reassembled motor](/assets/posts/vari-typer-1940/2x/IMG_3273.jpg){:standalone}{:standalone}

I removed all the wiring from the machine so I wouldn't have wires in the way.

While I asked online about the high 4500 rpm speed, somebody pointed out that the motor is specified for "intermittent" operation. It's an interesting thing that apparently motors were designed to run continuously, like an IBM Electric motor, or intermittently, which was clearly the case on the Vari-Typer. This means that there is not too much concern about the motor running for minutes or hours at a time and overheating, for example. Since the motor was meant to run every 13-17 characters, this means it was intended to turn on every few seconds, maybe every 10 seconds at most for a slow typist, or down to every few seconds for a fast typist. (Let's keep in mind that this machine was for typesetting, so it might be that you would type slower with it than a regular typewriter.) The point is that the motor would just turn on and off continuously, and had to wind that spring just a little but quickly. This is where the high rpm makes sense.

I also found online a picture of the back of a similar machine, and it shows that the motor is also in a skewed position! I had assumed that there was no way that this was by design, also comparing with my 1930 Varityper. But that picture indicated that this might not be a coincidence and that the motor was indeed mounted diagonally by design!

This later got confirmed by other pictures, including some from the 1940s manuals. So this means that the machine was not dropped badly as I thought might have happened.

![That's by design!](/assets/posts/vari-typer-1940/2x/manual-back.jpg){:standalone}{:standalone}

Finally, even the patent show the motor in this configuration. By now, there is absolutely no doubt this is all as it should be.

![That's by *patented* design!](/assets/posts/vari-typer-1940/2x/US2263642-1.jpg){:standalone}{:standalone}

## More evaluation

I removed the front panel to check the condition under the keys. There is some rust and it's not a pretty sight. One or two key levers are bent. The good news is that it's not *all* rust or *all* bent! Keys don't move smoothly.

![Surface rust](/assets/posts/vari-typer-1940/2x/IMG_3286.jpg){:standalone}{:standalone}

I can move the (20" wide) carriage to the right, and it locks on the escapement, which is a good thing. I can also release the carriage to the left. It's not smooth, but it's encouraging.

## The spring box

I removed all the wiring and then took out the spring assembly (labelled as "motor box" in the Varityper documentation). This assembly is actuated by the motor, which can wind the spring a little. When it's wound "enough", a switch stops the motor.

It's easy to remove this part from the machine. It can be open, carefully in case the spring is wound, and the parts taken out for cleaning and oiling.

![The parts before cleaning](/assets/posts/vari-typer-1940/2x/IMG_3310.jpg){:standalone}{:standalone}

I cleaned the parts with Simple Green, brushing and drying. It's interesting to see color show from underneath the grime. For example part of the switch and one of the cogwheels appear to be made of bakelite.

![The switch after cleaning](/assets/posts/vari-typer-1940/2x/IMG_3311.jpg){:standalone}{:standalone}

It turns out that the spring box is easy to open, although not as easy to close back. The spring inside was luckily not broken.

![The spring](/assets/posts/vari-typer-1940/2x/IMG_3327.jpg){:standalone}{:standalone}

I cleaned the parts more as they were greasy. You can see the middle, two-part triangular assembly, which connects to the other two rotating parts and pushes down a lever which actuates the switch.

![Cleaned parts](/assets/posts/vari-typer-1940/2x/IMG_3329.jpg){:standalone}{:standalone}

I reassembled the parts and connected the motor to see what would happen. It's making things turn, but in normal operation the main gear is locked due to the escapement. So we'll have to try it out in place once the rest of the machine starts moving.

![Putting things back together](/assets/posts/vari-typer-1940/2x/IMG_3330.jpg){:standalone}{:standalone}

I don't know if the machine will ever work properly again, but at least now I have a good idea of how these things fit together, which again can be useful for my other, nicer Varityper.

## The keyboard

I had a quick look at the keyboard. The keys are easy to remove for cleaning. Three keys: ",", ".", and the funny key to their right, have springs, interestingly. Removing the keys will make it easier to clean them and remove the superficial rust on them and their brackets, as well as cleaning them. It will also make it easier to clean the rest of the machine.

![Key levers and the lamp holder](/assets/posts/vari-typer-1940/2x/IMG_3402.jpg){:standalone}

## Scales

This machine has several scales, as the manufacturer called them. One of them in the back, called the "column selector scale", is fixed and has nice embossed (if that's the correct term) markings. I tried to clean the paint a little. Some small parts flaked away. It's not too bad even though it doesn't look perfect.

![The column selector scale, cleaned a little](/assets/posts/vari-typer-1940/2x/IMG_3397.jpg){:standalone}

The other is the spectacular, or at least iconic, triangular dial to the right of the machine.

![The dial before cleaning](/assets/posts/vari-typer-1940/2x/IMG_3412.jpg){:standalone}

Similarly, it has embossed marking. It is activated by linkages that go all the way to the back of the machine. I don't know yet exactly what it shows. I disassembled the indicator and the nearby bell for cleaning.

![Dial parts and the bell](/assets/posts/vari-typer-1940/2x/IMG_3436.jpg){:standalone}

The paint on the front panel, after cleaning, doesn't look too good. The paint in the back of that part, which we can't see normally, looks much better as it was not exposed!

![The paint suffered a little](/assets/posts/vari-typer-1940/2x/IMG_3439.jpg){:standalone}

## The paint

The main cover of the machine has rust. It definitely needs repainting. The carbon ribbon cover and the triangular indicator, discussed above, are not in great cosmetic shape either. One issue is that these parts used crinkle paint, typical of the period, and that's not something you can easily replicate at home. Some professional shops can do it, but that might be expensive.

The alternative might be to use regular, non-crinkle paint. It would change the style of the machine a little. Should I worry about this? There are competing ways of looking at restoring such machines, going from just preservation to restoring to as-new condition and anything inbetween.

But nothing prevents us from being a little creative. Let's face it, the Vari-Typer has never struck anybody to be pretty. So I would consider the possibility of spicing it up a little. For example, the front covers could be painted glossy red, or a combination of red and black, or some other colors that would attract the eye and distract from the boring, business machine look.[^remington] This might make the machine special and maybe even more likely to survive, at the price of not exactly matching the period paint. It would have to be done well, however. But this would be reversible: it's just paint after all, which can be stripped and redone. Here is a virtual simulation of what some red could look like.

![Would this be reasonable?](/assets/posts/vari-typer-1940/2x/national-museum-of-american-history-red.jpg){:standalone}

But then, I also found this picture, which definitely doesn't look good:

![This is NOT reasonable!](/assets/posts/vari-typer-1940/2x/repaint-green.jpg){:standalone}

To be fair, that one appears to be a poor quality repaint, but it's not recent from what I can tell. In addition, they shouldn't have painted the frame and paper guides. And of course, the color is… something.

On the other hand gloss black would look good too! And what about satin or matte black for the frame? I have also toyed in my mind with a cabernet or burgundy color to try to keep it classy. I like how the cabernet shows on the computer, but it might look very different in real life. So I will think about it and practice on a piece of sheet metal first. It is hard to visualize what the machine would look like with colors. And also xxx colors on the web.

![Some possible red colors](/assets/posts/vari-typer-1940/2x/color-red-montage.jpg){:standalone}

Or might some blue work as well?

![Some possible blue colors](/assets/posts/vari-typer-1940/2x/color-blue-montage.jpg){:standalone}

Asking for input on a collector's group, I got some fairly positive feedback about using color. I also got some suggestions to keep some parts polished metal, shiny or satin. Or maybe even plated? Clearly there are possibilities.

## The carriage

At some point I realized that if this machine was to get cleaned and fixed properly, the carriage would have to get out. The question was how! I tried to figure out how to get it out for hours and at some point thought I wouldn't succeed. There was always one part that seemed like it would get in the way, in particular the hammer, or something to the left or the right.

![Just before removing the carriage](/assets/posts/vari-typer-1940/2x/IMG_3517.jpg){:standalone}

Finally, I managed to do it by sliding the the left, after removing enough parts to the back and right of it! This is good news.

The carriage is pulled to the left like on most typewriters: using a spring box (a separate one!). Here, the drawband is made of steel, like on some other older machines.

I got the machine almost entirely "naked", which is good because it allows checking for almost everything.

![Not much  is left on the frame of the machine](/assets/posts/vari-typer-1940/2x/IMG_3525.jpg){:standalone}

I put a bunch of corroded parts in Evapo-Rust, my go-to for removing rust. I bought 4.5 gallons of it back in 2017 (almost 3 years ago), and I am still using some of that, as it is reusable. It's slowly reaching its end of life, though.

![Evapo-Rust bath](/assets/posts/vari-typer-1940/2x/IMG_3477.jpg){:standalone}

## The turret

The heart (or brain?) of a Hammond (and therefore a Varityper) is the emblematic turret which sits at the center of the machnine and is full of little rods and springs. The springs keep the rods down when at rest. Pressing a key pushes up the rod, which then protrudes at the top, and stops the movement of the rotating anvil so that the right character is positioned.

The problem with this machine was that there was a lot of rust, and some of the little rods were even stuck in place.

So I proceeded to disassemble the whole thing, then taking out the rods and springs. 8 of them turn out to be broken in the middle (I had 4 broken ones on my "parts" Hammond Multiplex). This might not prevent the machine from working, though.

![Rods and springs](/assets/posts/vari-typer-1940/2x/IMG_3471.jpg){:standalone}

In order to take out the top of the turret, I had to remove the ribbon cups. And to do that, I had to pull them out entirely, shafts included, after removing the cogwheels that sit under the machine.

There is an automatic ribbon-reverse system, which doesn't make sense when using a carbon ribbon. The manual confirms that the "carbon paper ribbon power mechanism replaces the right ribbon spool" and that the ribbon knob must be pulled out when using a carbon ribbon. So the machine could be used with a regular ribbon or a carbon ribbon.

It turns out that one part of the system is badly bent underneath the machine. I will attempt to fix that.

![Bent ribbon-reverse part](/assets/posts/vari-typer-1940/2x/IMG_3463.jpg){:standalone}

## Cleaning inside

As a first step, I applied PB Blaster liberally on the inside of the frame and brushed a little.

xxxx


## Variable pitch

The machine has an interesting system whereby you can, with a lever, change the pitch from 10, 12, 14 and 16. The shaft positions one of 4 cogwheels connected to the main escapement.

![One wheel for each pitch (before cleaning)](/assets/posts/vari-typer-1940/2x/IMG_3527.jpg){:standalone}

## Stuck stuff

Once the machine without turret and without carriage, the important thing to do was to make sure that everything is moving smoothly. I noticed that there are a few stuck parts.

Given all the rust and grime inside the machine, it is not surprising that some essential parts are not moving. The motor was another example. Hopefully the usual techniques to free up those parts will work.

### Turret

The part of the turret which the keys activate on the left side of the keyboard should move up and down very smoothly, but it doesn't.

With some PB Blaster it eventually started moving freely.

### Pitch selector

One part in the back, which is connected to the  pitch selector, is completely stuck. Even with PB Blaster and tapping it doesn't budge. I managed to take it out and put it in Evapo-Rust. Even after that it didn't move. I put it in a vise, tried to tap the part out, nothing moved. I then did a PB Blaster round, put it again in the vise, this time also tapped from the other side. I eventually saw some movement. Using punches I managed to get the rod out! Luckily, I didn't break these parts. They looked solid, and I was fairly cautious, but you never know.

![Punches can be of great help](/assets/posts/vari-typer-1940/2x/IMG_3555.jpg){:standalone}

Then I put it into Evapo-Rust again to remove possible corrosion on the rod and inside the tube. Some steel wool and oil, and it moves like a charm!

![This was badly stuck!](/assets/posts/vari-typer-1940/2x/IMG_3557.jpg){:standalone}

### Escapement

Part of the escapement is stuck. The bar which frees the escapement wheel when a key is depressed only moves with great effort. It should move with little friction.

As the escapement wasn't moving properly, I resolved to dunk the back of the machine into Evapo-Rust. It didn't help much if at all, after about 24 hours in Evapo-Rust.

As a next step, I tried to see if I could remove more of the escapement. It turns out I could! And that was a good thing as I was then able to clean those parts much better with Simple Green.

![Clean escapement parts](/assets/posts/vari-typer-1940/2x/IMG_3570.jpg){:standalone}

However, the stuck part is still stuck. Using a 1/4 inch wrench, I managed to remove the nut that was holding it in place from inside the frame. Then I had to remove another part that was blocking it, and I managed to take out the whole thing for cleaning!

![More escapement parts](/assets/posts/vari-typer-1940/2x/IMG_3619.jpg){:standalone}

## The impression control lever

This lever is to the left of the machine. It's rusty. It's on a shaft which holds it as well as the repetition key. Removing one screw and it's possible to take out the shaft.

![Rust on the impression control lever](/assets/posts/vari-typer-1940/2x/IMG_3692.jpg){:standalone}

I also removed the repetition key and its linkages so I could clean those parts.

![Impression control and repetition key](/assets/posts/vari-typer-1940/2x/IMG_3744.jpg){:standalone}

## The ribbon shaft

I wanted to remove the machine's left wing for cleaning and eventual repainting. However, the ribbon shaft has a knob which is too large for the whole through the left wing. I tried to see if I could unscrew the knob, but to no avail. So I considered removing the entire shaft, but it has 8 things attached to it! I will have to reposition them and adjust them correctly, which might be tricky. The good news is that some of those relate to the regular ribbon, and when using a carbon ribbon, for which this machine is configured, we don't care about the reverse mechanism. So I went for it and removed the shaft.

![Ribbon advance shaft and parts](/assets/posts/vari-typer-1940/2x/IMG_3752.jpg){:standalone}

There is even a tiny ball bearing and spring! This keeps the shaft stable in the left or right position when the ribbon reverse feature is in use.

![Ball bearing and spring](/assets/posts/vari-typer-1940/2x/IMG_3736.jpg){:standalone}

With this done, I was able to unscrew the main rail and take out the two wings which are still attached to it!

TODO: PIC

I also pulled out the main spring and its shaft.

![Main spring](/assets/posts/vari-typer-1940/2x/IMG_3749.jpg){:standalone}

After a basic cleaning:

![Main spring, cleaned](/assets/posts/vari-typer-1940/2x/IMG_3757.jpg){:standalone}

This is the spring which helps pulls the carriage. Unlike with non-electric Varitypers and the Hammond, this Vari-Typer has another spring wound by the motor, as described above.

## More cleaning

The frame of the machine is almost naked. The bottom of the turret is still there, and it is dirty, alongside other parts.

Further, I am not sure that everything moves as expected. When I press the space bar down, at some point there is a big "click" which doesn't seem right. It would be a drag, at this point, if something was badly out of place. So I need to figure out how things are supposed to move.

So I decided to remove the rest of the turret. For this, I needed to remove two axles on which the pyramid-like thingies (how are those things called anyway?) move. One of them unscrewed easily. The other one was stuck. Some PB Blaster helped and with that out of the way, I was able to remove the entire base of the turret, once a spring was removed.

I ended up with an extra screw on the table! This is frustrating. At this point, I have no idea where this screw comes from!

UPDATE: Later I ended up also with another extra screw and nut!

I cleaned the parts with Simple Green.

The base of the turret still has what are probably corrosion marks. In fact, it's not entirely clear to me what it is as the part is pretty clean at this point.

![Corrosion and/or dirt?](/assets/posts/vari-typer-1940/2x/IMG_3777.jpg){:standalone}

The moving parts are in pretty good shape now.

![Shiny moving parts](/assets/posts/vari-typer-1940/2x/IMG_3775.jpg){:standalone}

Three keys were still on the machine because, unlike the others, they are held in place with springs. I removed those and cleaned the springs.

The frame is now almost naked.

I also cleaned a few keys and key rings: steel wool and Mothers polish.

I also cleaned the springs that were holding the 3 keys.

As a little nice surprise, cleaning the escapement bearing reveals a nice bronze bearing (probably, as I know there are bronze bearing in motors).

I also cleaned and polished a little the hammer, which looked rough.

Finally, I took out the last part of the ribbon feed and reverse system for cleaning and in order to properly straighten the one that was bent.

![Cleaned and straightened](/assets/posts/vari-typer-1940/2x/IMG_4004.jpg){:standalone}

I removed the remaining keys, including the space bar. I disassembled the components of the space bar for derusting and cleaning.

![The space bar parts](/assets/posts/vari-typer-1940/2x/IMG_4057.jpg){:standalone}

I also removed the strong metal part onto which the key levers pivot. Interestingly, on Hammonds, this is part of the cast frame. Here, it is a separate part, attached with 3 screws.

## Paint stripping

The paint on the frame of the machine is not absolutely terrible but it's not great. So now that I have the frame almost naked, I have decided to
repaint the front and sides of the frame, as well as the parts visible when the front body panel is installed. I don't think I need to repaint  areas that are always hidden. I plan to repaint the frame in gloss black, which always looks classy. I think it will work even if I decide to go with another color for the body covers.

Now, to do a proper job, you don't just paint over the existing paint: you have to strip the existing paint down to the bare metal. I am using the Citri-Strip paint stripper. It's a paint stripper that's not too nasty. You can use it inside (well, in your garage or workshop) and it even smells good! I've had good results in the past on small parts, although I also had a couple of paints that resisted it. Here, good news: Citri-Strip works like a charm on the frame!

![Stripping paint is never a very clean task](/assets/posts/vari-typer-1940/2x/IMG_4094.jpg){:standalone}

The metal of the frame has obvious irregularities and will need good prep before painting. A filler will be required.

![The metal frame is not perfect](/assets/posts/vari-typer-1940/2x/IMG_4102.jpg){:standalone}

![The frame front and sides stripped](/assets/posts/vari-typer-1940/2x/IMG_4662.jpg){:standalone}

With the frame stripped, I did some more cleaning and used a wire brush. I had already cleaned the hammer a little, and I did some more. It originally looked quite rough. This is not like the Hammond's hammer which looked much better. I guess in the Vari-Typer the hammer is less visible and the machine is more utilitarian so they didn't care as much. But it already looks better than before.

<!--
![The hammer](/assets/posts/vari-typer-1940/2x/IMG_4672.jpg){:standalone}
-->

I also stripped the "paper table", which turns out to be a fairly strong piece of metal - which makes sense, given the 22 inch carriage width.

![Paper table stripping](/assets/posts/vari-typer-1940/2x/IMG_4545.jpg){:standalone}

## The sine bar

I learned, from reading from [US patent 2,263,642](), that this part is called the "sine-bar".

![The sine-bar: a shiny aluminium part](/assets/posts/vari-typer-1940/2x/IMG_4530.jpg){:standalone}

It's key to the whole justification mechanism. This bar is initially inclined down. It rises as the user types over the bell margin of the rough copy. Then it stays in position. When typing the justified copy (second column), a roller comes down the sine-bar. The bigger the inclination, the bigger the compensation at each step of the escapement. If it is horizontal, there is no compensation: the line if full. But if it is missing, say, 10 characters, the bar will be quite inclined, and each escapement step will add some compensation movement. So the characters will be spaced more.

On the following patent drawing, the sine-bar is number 35.

## The back feet

I thought the back support for the feet was "clearly" bent, and even had a rationale for that.

![This is bent, right?](/assets/posts/vari-typer-1940/2x/IMG_4681.jpg){:standalone}

Well, I thought that of the motor too. And well, well, well: just found [US patent 1,918,302](https://patents.google.com/patent/US1918302A/en) from July 18, 1933, by Frank H. Trego, which describes a "Frame extension for typewriting machines". Guess what: it shows a "bent" design:

> The cross-bar, as illustrated herein, is channel-shape in cross-section and is pressed up from sheet metal so that it is light and yet strong. It comprises an intermediate, horizontal section 23, which extends under the main-frame from one post 15 to the other, 70 and __inclined__ sections 24 extending upwardly from the central section 23 to the feet 19 so that said feet may be attached to the bottom side of said bar 20, which bottom side is at the same horizontal level as the bottom of the rear posts 15 in order that the same feet may be secured directly to the posts 15 (for short carriage machines) or may be secured to the ends of the frame extension 20 without affecting or altering the height of the machine.

## Painting the frame

Before painting the frame, I needed to practice my painting skills. I bought a while back some metal sheets for practice. So here is the process:

- sand the metal with xxx grit
- apply a coat of filler primer xxx
- wait for primer to dry
- sand primer
- xxx 2nd coat of primer
- sand
- xxx 3rd coat or primer?
- sand
- 1st coat of paint
- xxx
- try clear coat as well
-


xxx

I watched more videos, in particular about car paint jobs. This can be very involved, with a lot of professional equipment and supplies, and great skill too. I have none of these. Still, I want to see how far I can go, reasonably.

In the meanwhile, I also stripped the ribbon holder assembly at the top of the tower.

![The ribbon holder](/assets/posts/vari-typer-1940/2x/IMG_4412.jpg){:standalone}

I think that it might be a good idea to start with that part, as it's smaller, hopefully easier, and if I mess up, it will be easier to strip it again and start over. This needs to be repainted anyway, since the paint has clearly degraded on it.

![Stripped and sanded part](/assets/posts/vari-typer-1940/2x/IMG_4503.jpg){:standalone}

I think that a simple filler primer *should* work on this, as it's not rough like the machine's frame. For the frame, I will probably have to use some metal filler.


## Plating

There are a few parts that were nicely plated but which are now corroded, in particular the impression control and pitch control lever plates. It might be worth considering replating (or getting replated) those. Let's see, as the carriage also has some corroded parts.

## The dial

TODO: figure out how it's meant to work. See the manual xxx

"When the line has been completed, press the tabulator key, checking the bump of the carriage with the left hand. Strike the space bar once. Type the line exactly as it was typed at the left rough copy column. The machine will automatically stretch the line composed at the left to the desired column width which was pre-set."

## A surprise part

I found this part inside the machine:

![Surprise part](/assets/posts/vari-typer-1940/2x/IMG_3295.jpg){:standalone}

I was sure this was not part of this machine as it looked too clean. But in fact this is a margin stop! It must have fallen into the machine a long time ago, and it was protected from the elements since.

## Vari-Typer shuttles

Like the Hammond, the Vari-Typer uses *shuttles*, which are semi-circular plates which hold the characters. They are like the IBm Selectric's golf balls ("type elements"), or the Blickensderfer's type wheel.

My mathematical Varityper had 2 4-row mathematical shuttles. My Multiplex has 2 shuttles. But my Vari-Typer didn't have any. So I was on the lookout for those.

In April 2020, a fellow typospherian agreed to sell me some. Then that same week, I bought several sets from a seller on eBay! After a moment of euphoria, when I managed to get them, I started cataloguing them. And then I realized that most were for the *differential spacing" (proportional) Varitypers, that is, the later models. Both my Varitypers predate that.

This said, it's still good: among that collection of 77, 11 followed the older numbering system which means that they are fit for the "standard spacing" (monospace) Varitypers. In addition, some typefaces, like the Garamond, are close to being fixed space too.

Among that collection, there are few shuttles for Spanish, French, and what I assume is "international", with a series of diacritic letters. There is also a shuttle with mathematical symbols, which is pretty cool.

I was lucky enough that kind people had uploaded on Archive.org scans of booklets which list Varityper "type faces". So I now have the names of all but 5 of the typefaces on the shuttles.

xxxx add newer ones bought later (2020-09-11 included? also 2020-12-08, see spreadsheet)

These shuttles are different from the Hammond ones: they are gray and made of metal, while the Hammond shuttles are black and made of vulcanized rubber.

xxx TODO

## The wings

When I removed the wings, I kept them attached to the main carriage rod, because I wasn't sure I could remove them.

But since I want to repaint the wings, probably, it would be good to remove them. Using a punch, I managed to remove the parts from the rod. It wasn't too hard - but the use of a punch was a must.

xxx measure rod!

![Punching out the wings](/assets/posts/vari-typer-1940/2x/IMG_4820.jpg){:standalone}

The paint at that spot on the wings doesn't look too bad, but in other spots some paint is gone, and the inside of the wings got corrosion. Ideally, I would love those to keep their wrinkle paint, but I am not sure I will.

## The parts so far

Once the wings removed, I figured it was time for knolling. Here is the result.

![Knolled parts](/assets/posts/vari-typer-1940/2x/IMG_4831.jpg){:standalone}

## Spare parts

In September 2020, I got a few spare parts from Don in Texas. He has the same Vari-Typer, but I would say in worse condition than mine, so I don't feel too bad getting parts from it! In any case, I got a new foot, some carriage parts and screws, another (broken) lamp post and button, and a couple of parts that were broken or missing on my machine.
