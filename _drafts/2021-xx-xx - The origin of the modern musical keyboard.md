I have been wondering when the current layout of the piano keyboard came to existence. You know, the type with the seven white keys and the 5 black keys and repeating I had trouble finding a clear answer immediately so I set to do a bit more research. This has led me to a brick-and-mortar library and even to an inter-library loan, because unfortunately not all of mankind's writings are available online just yet.

The earliest keyboards known were pipe organ \[10\] keyboards. This makes sense, because unless you want the instrument to play always the same sound, you do need a mechanism to control air flow to the pipes. Now when we talk about keyboards here, we xxxx spacing wrt pipes.

The pipe organ was invented as early as the 3rd century BC (so more than 2,200 years ago), and the first instruments were powered by water and called hydraulis \[13\]. The remains of a 1st century BC hydraulis were found in 1992, and "the instrument had two rows of keys" \[11\] A reconstruction of that hydraulis was made \[12\], and it features a keyboard with evenly spaced keys. As the remains found didn't include wood (which had decomposed), it is likely that the reconstructed primitive keyboard is guesswork. It seems (possibly unreliable source) that we do know that "the lower (bass) notes were situated on the left, and higher (treble) notes were situated on the right \[and the\] notes of the Hydraulis consisted only of seven basic notes (A, B, C, D, E, F, & G)" \[14\].

In the Middle Ages, "organs had found their way into churches by the end of the tenth century" \[3\], and a certain Theophilius (early 12th century) reports in his _Schedula diversarum artium_ "wooden sliders projecting from the chest \[of the organ\] and lettered so that the player knew which note he was sounding" \[3\]

In the middle of the 13th century, a [Cantigas de Santa Maria](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantigas_de_Santa_Maria) illumination shows portative organs with keyboards. It's hard to tell for sure but they appear to have a single row of evenly spaced keys. So no certain trace of "black keys" as of yet.

_Illumination from the [Cantigas de Santa Maria](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantigas_de_Santa_Maria)_

But "Jacobus of Liège, writing around 1330, specifies that in certain instruments, including the organ, almost everywhere the tone is divided into two unequal semitones (based on the Pythagorean intonation)". \[5\] Also, "Johannes de Muris (first half of the 14th century) mentioned keys for f# and g#". \[GROVE\]

This takes us to 1361, with "[the first documented permanent organ installation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipe_organ)" in Halberstadt, Germany. And that is fascinating because this instrument featured the pattern of a modern keyboard ("The first recorded keyboard with this arrangement was built by one Nicholas Faber in Halberstadt, Germany in the year 1361" \[1\]). This organ was "reported to have twenty-two keys, with wind power supplied by twenty bellows operated by ten men" \[2\]. This layout can be seen on  the engravings below (left and top right panels):

_From the Syntagma Musicum by Michael Praetorius (1619 or 1620)_


It's pretty clear that it was not exactly like a modern piano or organ, as the keys look more like levers, they are spade-shaped, and they were spaced further apart than the modern keyboard. You probably wouldn't play those as you would a modern keyboard: "The Halberstadt keyboard had keys probably 2 inches (5) cm) or more wide, intended to be played with the entire hand" \[1\]. "Praetorius mentioned keys about 8 cm wide for the Halberstadt organ" \[xxx Grove\] The Cambridge Companion to the Organ: "It is not known whether keys were ever 'thumped' with the whole fist as used to be suggested, but \[…\] the early organs would require some force to operate" \[3\]. Still, the concept is there already.


So far, except for the antique hydraulis, we have only documentary evidence. But there are remains of an organ built around 1400, the Norrlanda (Sweden) organ. It is no longer playable (no more pipes) but it is on display in Stockholm, alongside a reconstruction: "The world’s oldest surviving organ fragments, dating c1370-1400 \[The\] case remains intact with its original keyboard, pedals \[…\], action, and windchests \[…\] The organ has a fully chromatic manual compass of 22 keys \[…\] The keys for diatonic notes, including B♭, are on one level, with keys for C#, D#, F#, and G# arranged in pairs on a higher level." \[6\] The picture shows clearly shows the two rows of keys.

_Keyboard of the Norrlanda organ_

It is interesting that the B♭, instead of being the 5th "black key", is alongside the other keys. This tells us that they hadn't yet figured out for sure what the best layout was. \[7\]

The Ghent Altarpiece by Jan and Hugo van Eyck (1432) is taking us even closer to a modern keyboard appearance. You can see on the picture that the black keys have a "block" shape consistent with what you see on a modern piano or organ. The bottom of the white keys on the other hand have a rounder shape similar to those of the Norrlanda organ.

This might seem a bit funny, until you know more. And we do: a scholar, Edwin M. Ripin, mentions in a 1974 article \[8\] that infrared pictures of that altarpiece reveals a more ancient keyboard layout! The main difference is in the black keys: gone are the block-shaped keys, and at least three black keys a la Norrlandia appear on top:



[![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-FajgnT6z3EE/UB77PzqszPI/AAAAAAAAApM/9P52dsx73p4/s640/Older+keyboard.jpg)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-FajgnT6z3EE/UB77PzqszPI/AAAAAAAAApM/9P52dsx73p4/s1600/Older+keyboard.jpg)

_More ancient keyboard revealed by infrared_

Even the performer's left hand was redrawn to be taller after the repaint. The reasoning is that the original keyboard depicted might have lacked "black" keys where the hand is positioned, allowing for a flatter hand, however the modern keyboard would not have allowed such a hand position. The right hand, taller, might indicate that there are black keys underneath.

So, if the update to the painting indeed dates from 1432 (as the article and the infrared work date from the 70s, it would be interesting to know if newer information is now available), we have here a painting of a fairly modern-looking keyboard by that date. But the painting was hacked, and knowing that, the keyboard looks a bit weird. For example, the keys are very short, which might have been ok with a Norrlandia-style keyboard, but not for a block-style keyboard. Although "the natural heads remained quite short, about 3.5 cm, up to the 18th century" \[xxx Grove\] It might not have been possible to easily draw longer keys, or, who knows, maybe block-sized keyboards with keys that short existed? That's probably still speculation at this point.

One can assume that this keyboard hacking was motivated because organs now sported such block-shaped keys.

The same _Syntagma Musicum_ that showed us the Halberstadt keyboards features the following engraving of the keyboard of the organ at Aegidienkirche in Brunswick, supposed to be from 1456:




[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1Ks914o9sCA/UATsEEQhOgI/AAAAAAAAAmo/2AIv4G-eK50/s1600/Syntagma16+copy.png)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1Ks914o9sCA/UATsEEQhOgI/AAAAAAAAAmo/2AIv4G-eK50/s1600/Syntagma16+copy.png)[![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-i2lVnuFUY24/UATsDnxUj3I/AAAAAAAAAmg/OTr7Mr_a6Jg/s1600/Syntagma15+copy.png)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-i2lVnuFUY24/UATsDnxUj3I/AAAAAAAAAmg/OTr7Mr_a6Jg/s1600/Syntagma15+copy.png)




Now that's even closer from a modern keyboard construction: the keys are longer, not like on the hacked altarpiece. The black keys are a bit taller than today's. We notice that there appears to be a reasonable progression here.

Finally, the oldest playable (and played) organ \[9\], estimated to have been built in the 1430s (almost 600 years ago!), happens to be located in Sion, Switzerland, not far from my home town The current keyboard of the Sion organ looks too new to be original (see picture).

_Keyboard of the Valère (Sion) organ (built ca. 1430)_

However, is it reasonable to imagine that the original organ had an identical layout? You would think that if the keyboard was not originally fully chromatic (12 notes), it would have been hard to retrofit it to add the missing pipes. On the other hand a lot could have happened in 600 years. Still, given the evidence from 1361, 1400, 1432, and 1456, it doesn't appear impossible that the Sion organ had a chromatic keyboard. There is one report that "the keyboard is medieval", which would mean from the 15th century. \[4\]. But which part is medieval? Surely not the actual covering of the keys? But the rest of the keyboard? Do we know for sure? There are still some open questions here.

Related, the [Robertsbridge Codex](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robertsbridge_Codex) (1360) from the 14th century "contains the earliest surviving music written specifically for keyboard", and "\[m\]ost likely the instrument used to play the pieces in the Codex was the organ". The music implies a range of "two octaves and a 3rd \[…\] (fully chromatic above f)" \[GROVE\]  The video below shows how different Middle Ages music sounded from Baroque and Classical era music (that, or we interpret the music really wrong!).

In conclusion, here are some take-aways based on that online research:

*   Keyboards, at least primitive ones, are very old and likely go back all the way to the first organs (3rd century BC hydraulis).
*   There is evidence in the first half of the 14th century (Jacobus of Liège) that some keyboards had more than the diatonic scale (i.e. had introduced "black  keys").
*   There is evidence (engravings showing the keyboards of the Halberstadt organ) that around 1361 the modern layout had been invented, although there is not yet evidence of block-shaped keys.
*   There is physical evidence (remnants of the Norrlandia organ) that around 1400, keyboards with something very close from the modern layout existed, but still without block-shaped keys.
*   There is documentary evidence (Ghent Altarpiece painting) that in 1432, keyboards with block-shaped black keys existed.
*   There is documentary evidence (engravings showing the Aegidienkirche in Brunswick organ) for long, block-shaped keys around 1456.
*   The Sion organ might be additional evidence for a fully modern keyboard (long block-shaped keys) as early as the 1430s, but some more research would be needed to confirm this.
