## Acquisition

In November 2019, I acquired an IBM Model A Executive from 1951. I had a choice between two machines [^othera]. I chose this one, with gray tones, which I found more appealing. The seller was kind enough to provide an IBM Model A Standard to go along with it for parts, including a better power roller (which I haven't used so far).

## Background

Most typewriters use fixed-pitch (often called ["monospaced"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monospaced_font) nowadays), where each character takes the same amount of horizontal space. This is how you can talk about Pica (with 10 characters per inch) and Elite (12 characters per inch) typefaces.

IBM's "Executive" models, on the other hand, introduced *proportional* spacing, where each character can take a different number of "units" of width: the "." would be two units xxx, for example, and the "W" might be 4 or 5.

IBM announced their first proportional model, called the Model 04 by collectors, in 1940 of 1941. However, due to World War 2, the machine was only released in 1944. The Model A Executive is the successor to that model, the first redesign since IBM acquired Electromatic in 1933.

Executive models were expensive: the equivalent of about $5,000 in 2021 US dollars! [^memorytypewriter]

After the Model A and Model A Executive, IBM went on to produce models B, C and D, all with their Executive counterparts. In the end, these machines sold concurrently with the Selectric, introduced in 1961.

All these machines (but not the Selectric) are based on the invention of the "power roller", patented by J. F. Smathers in 1913 already. The history of how this was eventually brought to market and made a success is pretty neat.

## Restoration

When I bought it, the machine worked to a point, which was already a good thing, but not perfectly. It skipped, and the carriage return was not working reliably. So I set to make it work properly.

The machine's body is easy to remove: take off the feet, unscrew 6 screws, and that's it. Well, almost: you must also disconnect the ribbon advance linkage and the spring belt that makes the ribbon advance.

The inside of the machine was quite clean, surprisingly. No dust bunnies here at all! Still, I used compressed air to blow whatever might be inside.

I used PB Blaster to make the escapement move reliably.

I cleaned the left and right ribbon assemblies and, in fact took them out entirely. It's a beautiful part, if you ask me.

I also put new grommets for the left side assembly as the old ones were very hard.

I removed the old soundproofing material, which was deteriorating. I scraped and used some Goo Gone as well.

I cleaned the body panels with Simple Green and a toothbrush, finishing the job with WD-40 which gives the crinkle paint a nice shine. The IBM logo looks really nice!

I removed the platen, which is very easy, to clean the carriage. I also remove the carriage's end covers for cleaning.

I was advised to open up the motor to clean it, and so that's what I did! To remove the motor and in fact to access most wiring, you need to remove a plate underneath the machine.

I cleaned the motor parts with Simple Green, and lubricated the axle a little. The motor actually ran well before cleaning. It runs quite silently, and most of the noise of the machine doesn't come from the motor itself.

This is a brushless motor.

The motor's wiring was fine luckily, but the 3 wires coming out of it were a little bit worrying. I used heatshrink tubing and black electrical tape to protect the old insulation better.

I figured the 3 uF capacitor would benefit from being replaced, and I ordered a new motor start/motor run capacitor. The new capacitor is large but smaller than the original one. I struggled a little to find a spot to attach it but eventually found one.

I used a new power cord and actually grounded the machine's frame. The old power cord was not in great shape, and while it had 3 wires, and the ground wire was connected to the frame, the plug only had two prongs! I saw on pictures that some cables had an extra ground wire which you could connect separately.

I was told that the machine actually had insulation: the body of the machine is attached to the rest of the frame via rubber grommets, and so in theory you shouldn't get shocked even if there is a faulty wire. But excuse me if I think that using an actual ground wire is better here!

I am only 80% happy with my rewiring. I used cable ties and wire nuts. I wish I had crimped the ground wire to a new connector, but right now it also goes through a wire nut to the original ground connector.

The keyboard plate also comes off easily. I cleaned the keys. Some of the key legends were partially gone, and I used Laquer-Stick to fix that. It's not perfect but if you don't know you probably won't notice it.

I then reassembled the machine. It worked fairly well.

I thought that the ribbon feed mechanism was wasting ribbon. I reopened the body to adjust the ribbon feed link, based on what I saw in the service manual, but I am not sure it was better and I had to adjust the other end of the link too. It seemed better after that but I am not sure! My worry is wasting ribbon, that is, if you have too much unused ribbon between each letter. The two wheels that pinch the ribbon have rubber that is hard, and they can slip a little on the ribbon. That might also explain part of the problem. Right now, I think the ribbon advance is ok.

You have to lubricate the small metal belt that moves the ribbon, as that's entirely based on friction.


In January, I removed the body panels again.

First, I replaced the tab Clear/Set buttons. The Set button was broken originally, and I finally got to removing those from the Model B. The color is different, intersetingly: it was brown on the Executive, but blue on the Standard. Yet the Expalnd/Color buttons on the Executive have the same blue, so thew "new" buttons mach really well. The transfer was very easy. I polished the buttons with polishing compound and they look fairly nice.

I also ordered some Noico car soundproofing material.

![New Noico soundproofing material](/assets/posts/ibm-a-executive/2x/IMG_2931.jpg){:standalone}

Those are made of butyl rubber, I believe. They have a metallic side, I assume so that the rubber doesn't touch anything as it's quite soft; and an adhesive side. I cut the parts and placed them on the body panels.

So far I did NOT apply to the top cover or the ribbon covers.


I *think* it makes a difference? Compared to a manual machine, the electric machine is likely to vibrate much more! At some point, the machine was vibrating a lot! This seems to help a little so far, although it's not a scientific test.

## The typeface

This machine has the "Modern" typeface, one of the most common ones. But I think that it looks quite neat.

## Usage

xxx so fast; neat print; ribbons

## Conclusion

One thing that I have learned fixing typewriters is that perfection is hard to reach. I don't doubt that people who are more skilled and/or have more time can, but I rarely do! So it's no surprise to me that the machine still has a few remaining issues:

- the "three units" space bar only advances by two units
- the "Clear" key doesn't come back up on its own (it does on the A Standard)
- there is a small broken metal part on the left ribbon cover
- if you jam two keys (which is not supposed to happen), the ribbon will keep advancing until you unjam the typebars
- the "Expand" button is active when pointing down, and I assumed it should be the opposite (not a big problem!)
- the tab has some precision issues

I might yet clean and polish a few remaining parts.

But none of those are showstoppers and this is actually a fun machine to use! It's *fast*.

I think it looks pretty good. Some people said that this was the ugliest machine they had ever seen. Some called it beautiful. It's in the eye of the beholder!

This must be one of the few Model A Executive in operation on the planet. For some reason, they get little love, but I seem to like focusing on this kind of forgotten machines.

UPDATE 2019-12-08: After cleaning, lubrication, power cord (including grounding of the frame) and capacitor replacement, the machine works much better to the point where you can type entire pages. It still uses the carbon ribbon which was in the machine when I bought it.

UPDATE 2020-01-25: The machine now has new soundproofing, a replacement foot, and replacement tab "Clear"/"Set" buttons. Pictures upcoming.

Surprisingly, the power roller still works reliably!

[^othera]: I eventually got that other one as well, which is beige color.

[^memorytypewriter]: And still this is reasonable compared to the $25,000 that a 1974 IBM Memory Typewriter would cost (in 2021 US dollars again).
