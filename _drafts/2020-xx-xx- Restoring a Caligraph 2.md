## Background

It is hard to resist the visual appeal of the *Caligraph*. This machine came out in 1881 and was the first competitor to the Remington typewriter. It was developed by George Washington Newton (or Napoleon) Yost, who was the man who managed to sell the machine designed by Christopher Latham Sholes to Remington, and then was instrumental in marketing the Remington machines. For the Caligraph, Yost obtained an agreement for patents with James Densmore, another important early typewriter persona who worked with Sholes, in 1880. It was complicated, but it happened. So while the Caligraph competed with the Remington machines, it nevertheless had many of the same ideas and people behind it.

In spite of all the shared history and technical similarities, the Caligraph has a very distinctive look. I find that it is a beautiful machine. It has this very large type basket at the back, holding 72 typebars (in the case of the Caligraph 2), and its signature hand rest with a large decal in the front. Its frame is very open. It was mechanically quite simple, probably simpler than the Remington.

Like the Sholes and Glidden and early Remingtons, the Caligraph has wooden key levers. The minimalistic open frame and the wooden levers contribute to the machine being fairly light, at 19.8 lbs (9 kg), even though it is fairly large. Compare this with the 26.8 lbs (12 kg) Remington 6 (I don't have a Remington 2 or a Sholes and Glidden to compare!), or a 28.8 lbs (13 kg), with base, Oliver 5.

The machine was named by James Densmore, who had also named the "Type-Writer" ("type writing machine" was already in use). Back then, the "type-writer" meant the machines made by Remington (the Sholes & Glidden and soon the Remington 2).

## This machine

While the Caligraph 1 is a very rare machine, the Caligraph 2 is uncommon but not truly rare. You occasionally find one for sale on eBay, for example - but at prices that have not been appealing to me!

In June 2020, I had a chance to buy this Caligraph 2 which was sold on eBay for local pickup and within driving distance. When the seller reduced the price, it got too tempting, and I clicked the "Buy" button. On a nice Saturday morning, I drove the 1 1/2 hour to the seller's, and this Caligraph 2 serial 37397 was then fully mine.

There is no doubt that the machine is in fairly rough condition (bad paint, rust and corrosion). But I don't see why it wouldn't be restorable. I have now also, in a few years of collecting, gained some level of confidence about restoring such machines, even though this one presents some interesting challenges.

![The beauty as I got it](/assets/posts/caligraph-2/2x/IMG_5423.jpg){:standalone}

This machine screams for complete disassembly, cleaning, repainting, new decals and pinstripes, and replating of several parts. Three keys are replacements. The main spring (which is under the machine) is broken, as is common with this machine.

![Bottom with the broken main spring](/assets/posts/caligraph-2/2x/IMG_5540.jpg){:standalone}

On the plus side, none of the wooden key levers are broken (although one has some damage where the spring hooks into it).

This machine didn't come with a base or cover. It would be nice to make a base for it. I like the look of those nice wooden bases.

## Dating

We don't have a good list of serials by year for the Caligraph. The Caligraph 2 was introduced in 1881, and produced until about 1893 or 1894. Some recent casual research by al Sumrall [^sumrall] looks at serials and the author says that "So far it appears the last of the 2's was in the 38,000 range circa 1893." You find several claims online about Caligraphs from 1881 or 1882, but that is in reality unlikely.

My machine is probably from 1893 or 1894, with serial 37397. The serial is visible in two places: one on the top plate (front left), and another one on bottom right of the frame. This machine is one of the last Caligraph 2 produced. No matter how imprecise the dating, it is almost certain it was made in the early 1890s, as opposed to the 1880s.

Even so, this makes it probably my oldest machine at this point. I say "probably" because I also have a Smith Premier 1 from the 1890s, which is from about the same time as Caligraph. But here too serial numbers are not well established. The Caligraph is the oldest typewriter *design* I have, though - until I find a nice Remington 2!

Incidentally, this is tentatively my third machine from the 19th century, after the Smith Premier 1 and a Densmore 4 which is possibly from 1899.

## Restoration

### Rationale

With machines that are in better shape, you can ask yourself lots of questions: should you repaint this, replate that, etc. In other words, should you attempt a conservative cleaning and restoration, in order to preserve the machine's materials and history? But here, the machine is in such poor shape that to me there is no doubt that it requires full restoration rather than minor fixes and preservation.

This is good news because it simplifies the process. I don't have to worry about restoring it "too much". The machine is already damaged. We are lucky that it was not scrapped. Rust and corrosion have altered all the paint and all the plating, with only minor exceptions. The machine can only go up from here.

In addition, again, while the Caligraph 2 is uncommon, it is not a truly rare machine. There are many surviving examples. So I don't have to worry too much about restoring a unique piece "incorrectly".

This said, I do want to do a good job. I won't repaint it pink or baby blue - although a classy pearl white would be tempting - it would look great with gold pinstripes! My plan is to strip the frame entirely and repaint it (or have it repainted). Many parts must also be replated with nickel.

Properly repainting and replating will make it very shiny. I am not sure there is a much better option, though. I don't think it makes sense to fake old and damaged paint and plating! But there are pictures online of machines with very shiny plating, in particular the Caligraph 2 on Martin Howard's site. So I think I will be in good company.

On my Remington 6 from 1902, I had two parts replated: the curved shift bar, and the ribbon guide. I think that they look fantastic on that machine, with most of the rest original.

![1902 Remington 6 with replated ribbon guide](/assets/posts/caligraph-2/2x/IMG_7284.jpg){:standalone}

### Overview of the restoration process

Here is a general overview of my process:

1. Take pictures of the machine in its *before* condition, including close-ups of interesting parts.
1. Research what others say about restoring this particular machine: potential issues, things to do and not to do, and so on. There are a few articles online which cover some of that for the Caligraph 2, but without too many details.
1. Take the machine entirely apart and start cleaning the parts, taking more pictures along the way.
1. Restore parts as needed.
1. Reassemble the machine.
1. Adjust the machine. Here, I expect that aligning the typebars will be the difficult part.

In parallel, we must give some consideration to finding or making the missing parts, including the ribbon spools.

### The unknowns

The Caligraph is a simple machine, and I have some experience with the Restoration of the Remington 6, Vari-Typer (in progress), and the repair of several other machines like the Oliver 5, etc. So I am not terribly worried about working on it. But each project is different, and there are big unknowns to me:

- How much replating will be needed, and whether I should attempt to do it or part of it at home.
- How to do a good job repainting the frame. It must be stripped, and ideally sandblasted, then painted really well.
- How to reproduce the pinstripes.
- How to fix or replace the main spring. I have seen online that some have installed a replacement spring.

![Small portion of reasonably-preserved pinstriping](/assets/posts/caligraph-2/2x/IMG_5538.jpg){:standalone}

In addition, the following parts, at least, will have to be redone or found:

- The 3 missing keys. I am thinking that 3D printing might be a good option here.
- Fix the missing knob and spring in the back.
- Find or make 2 ribbon spools.

### First steps

I started by removing the front cover to see the condition of what's underneath.

I also put PB Blaster on a series of screws to remove them.

I managed to remove the carriage after applying PB Blaster to the 4 screws. You obviously want to be careful when removing screws with rust. Breaking one would be very annoying.

I put many parts in Evapo-Rust to do a first rust removal pass. This also helps seeting what's underneath the rust, or assess where what looked like rust was actually not rust.

The result is that, well, some parts are in fact quite corroded. This one is probably the worst.

![The worst of corrosion](/assets/posts/caligraph-2/2x/IMG_5529.jpg){:standalone}

### The type basket

This is a tough one. Obviously, the type basket is a major part of the Caligraph. But in order to repaint the frame properly, it probably needs to be torn down. I can't see how it's possible to keep it in place while stripping, sanding, priming, and painting the frame. There are 72 typebars held in place by 72 very tight screws. Those must be removed without breaking them. When the frame is ready, they will have to be put back, and realigned.

![The type basket with 72 of everything](/assets/posts/caligraph-2/2x/IMG_5713.jpg){:standalone}

Now the question is whether to proceed with the disassembly. I have received rather negative advice, even from one person that has done it. Besides the amount of work, one issue is, as expected, alignment. You can't just realign the types with your eyes and hands only. You need an alignment device ("jig"). We have pictures of such jigs for Remington machines. In principle, it's not too hard: you "just" need something that can ensure all the types end up in the center. In practice, of course that's another story. You can build something made of metal, or wood, or maybe even 3D printed. How well the alignment will end up is anyone's guess.

![Remington alignment jig](/assets/posts/caligraph-2/2x/alignment.jpg){:standalone}

I also found a 1994 ETCetera by Bob Aubert about restoring a Caligraph 1 completely. Of course, the Caligraph 1 is rarer and therefore more worth restoring compared to the 2. But Bob did it, including repainting, pinstriping, replating, etc. He wrote back then that he spent 160 hours doing it. The Caligraph 2 has even more parts. Maybe some of the process can be streamlined.

![Bob Aubert's 1994 article](/assets/posts/caligraph-2/2x/aubert.jpg){:standalone width="75%"}

In any case, I wanted to see whether it is even *possible* for me to remove the typebars. So I started with applying PB Blaster liberally on one area, over and under, to see if I can loosen them. And it turns out I can: I managed to unscrew two of the screws. I removed one to see if it can be polished. Interestingly, it polished rather dark. It would look better than it does now. I think it the only issue was corrosion on the metal, I would not tear down the basket. But I need to repaint the frame. That's the key issue.

Also, regarding alignment, one other typewriter tinkerer didn't disassemble the basket, but still ended up with a massively misaligned machine. In short, these machines might need realignment anyway! Although of course there is a chance that the misalignment is only partial, and that removing everything will make things that much harder.

Still, as of mid-June 2020, I am leaning towards the full tear down.

### Basket tear down plan

Each typebar is attached to a hinge ("journal") and a linkage ("long connecting rod", "turnbuckle", and "short connecting rod") that reaches one of the wooden slats or key levers. Unlike with the Remington 6, I don't think there is an easy way to detach the linkage from the typebar. I could bend some metal parts and probably separate the linkages, but it seems dangerous. Or I could try to unscrew the turnbuckles, which allows adjusting precisely the length of the linkage, but that's calling for really a lot of extra work! So I think I will remove the entire typebar, linkage, and wooden slat, and keep those together. I need to remove the key levers anyway.

So here is the plan:

- Loosen the 72 screws.
- Remove all keys and put in an organizer.
- Carefully move the front bar which holds all the springs.
- Remove 3 screws.
- Move the metal bar ("front reed bar") forward.
- Starting with the center of the machine, remove all the assemblies and put all parts in an organizer.

Once this is done, the frame will be essentially naked. It can then be safely stripped, etc.


### Removing the keys

The Caligraph 2 has 72 keys organized in 6 rows, or "banks", of 12 keys. Each bank, in addition to its 12 keys, consists of a so-called "bridge". The 6 bridges are different, since the holes guide the keys to match the position of the wooden key levers underneath.

![The 6 bridges](/assets/posts/caligraph-2/2x/bridges.jpg){:standalone}

The Caligraph keyboard is QWERTY-inspired, but it's not QWERTY. Here is the layout (just approximating the staggering of the keys):

```
V W 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 J K
 R T E ( $ q & z ) U G H
A S w t r e y u i o I O
 D F a s d f g h c k N L
B C j x v b n l m p M P
 Q X : ; ' ? " . , - Y Z
```

The keyboard of the Caligraph 2 is so-called *full*, or *double*, or also *complete* (seen in a Smith Premier ad), because there is no *shift* key and, instead, there is a separate key for each character, including lowercase and uppercase. But note that even though this is a full keyboard, the keys are *staggered*.

![The Caligraph 2's full, but staggered, keyboard](/assets/posts/caligraph-2/2x/IMG_5427.jpg){:standalone}

The staggered design is because each key is aligned with its corresponding wooden key lever, and those have to be next to each other. This is exactly like the Remington 2, but with almost double the number of keys. However, on the Caligraph, the keys are attached around the middle of the wooden slats, and the slats pivot in the front of the machine instead of the back.

This, by the way, is very different from another full keyboard design, that of the later Smith Premier, where all keys were in perfect columns. Smith Premier managed to do this thanks to a very smart system of rotating rods instead of key levers. Today, we call keyboards where keys are aligned in columns *ortholinear* ("ortho" = straight, "linear" = in a line).

![1902 Smith Premier 2 with full ortholinear keyboard](/assets/posts/caligraph-2/2x/IMG_7288.jpg){:standalone}

Some fancy computer keyboards are built that way.

![Example of a modern ortholinear computer keyboard](/assets/posts/caligraph-2/2x/ortholinear.jpg){:standalone}

Here is a summary of similarities and differences between the keyboards:

|Machine|Full|Levers|Alignment|Pivot|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Remington 2|No|Wood slats|Staggered|Back|
|Caligraph|Yes|Wood slats|Staggered|Front|
|Smith Premier|Yes|Metal rods|Ortholinear|Axis|

I had no big difficulty removing the keys. Each key is attached to its corresponding key lever with a stem that fits in an attachment. Each key needs to be pulled out without breaking anything. I used pliers with a piece of plastic to protect the stem, and was careful not to pull too hard on the keys so as not to damage the wooden slats or linkages.

![Removing a key](/assets/posts/caligraph-2/2x/IMG_5569.jpg){:standalone}

The keys need to be removed in order to remove the wooden key levers. Once the 72 keys are removed, the 6 bridges can be removed. It is necessary to remove the bridges for cleaning and painting, but not strictly to remove the wooden key levers.

![All the keys removed and organized](/assets/posts/caligraph-2/2x/IMG_5710.jpg){:standalone}

### The basket screws

Over the span of a few days, I loosened all 72 basket screws. I started with PB Blaster, but was then advised to try Kroil, which worked fine. It was definitely necessary to use a penetrating oil. I don't have a tool to measure the torque I had to apply to unlock the screws, but without PB Blaster or Kroil I had to stop applying torque at some point. After applying the oil, I didn't reach that uncomfortable point, and if I did, I reapplied oil, waited a while, and then tried again.

![Basket screws soaked with Kroil](/assets/posts/caligraph-2/2x/IMG_5701.jpg){:standalone}

So now I have a machine with all the keys removed and all the basket screws loosened.

### Removing and cleaning the wooden slats and typebars

The "front reed bar" must be moved so that the key levers can be removed in turn. You remove 3 screws, and then the bar can be moved forward to free the springs associated with the key levers.

![The front reed bar](/assets/posts/caligraph-2/2x/IMG_5556.jpg){:standalone}

Just remove the matching basket screw and you can take out the entire assembly.

![The first slat is removed](/assets/posts/caligraph-2/2x/IMG_5715.jpg){:standalone}

This is a significant part of the restoration work: there is 72 of everything, which means that it's time-consuming and repetitive.

It's important to keep track of the order the key levers are and their position in the basket. So I am taking notes for each of those. I printed a view of the basket to mark the position of each lever.

There is a mix of gunk and rust. Luckily, it's not all rust! Each type bar and linkage must be cleaned and derusted. I start with a brass brush, then dunk in Evapo-Rust, like I did for the Remington 6.

![A lot of gunk and rust](/assets/posts/caligraph-2/2x/IMG_5769.jpg){:standalone}

After that, I use a Dremel with different types of wire brushes, and a polishing wheel. I am also cleaning the slats with water, as they are very dirty. Finally, I will try to coat the metal with something - Boeshield T-9, probably. I don't think replating the links is necessary.

These pictures show the first assemblies dunking in Evapo-Rust. The product is initially very transparent, but it quickly becomes dark as rust is taken away. The more rust (and dirt!) on parts, the sooner the product will become dark. But it's still quite effective for a long time.

![Typebar and link in Evapo-Rust](/assets/posts/caligraph-2/2x/IMG_5724.jpg){:standalone}

![Typebar and link in Evapo-Rust](/assets/posts/caligraph-2/2x/IMG_5725.jpg){:standalone}

Here are the first cleaned metal parts. That's after Evapo-Rust, a wire brush, and a small polishing wheel. The wood hasn't really been cleaned yet. That's much better, but patina will still show, which is of course fine.

![Partially-cleaned key levers, links, and type bars](/assets/posts/caligraph-2/2x/IMG_5735.jpg){:standalone}

There are 72 keys. If I process 4 a day, that will take me 18 days, or about 3 weeks! The reason I am going so slow is that I do this part-time. Also, it is just time-consuming to remove, catalog, brush, Evapo-Rust, rinse, wipe, Dremel, polish, apply wood oil, and check each assembly. But I am not in a hurry, and I can listen to podcasts while doing this. I estimate that it takes more than an hour of work to process a batch of 4, so 18 hours of work for the 72 assemblies. But it's probably a little more than that.

The hanger washers (that sit between the screws and the hangers) clean up nicely too. I put them in Evapo-Rust, brushed them, then polished them a little. They each hold 5 screws, except for one part which holds 2.

![Washer before](/assets/posts/caligraph-2/2x/IMG_5779.jpg){:standalone}

![Washer after](/assets/posts/caligraph-2/2x/IMG_5795.jpg){:standalone}

I am putting back the screws and washers temporarily, so I don't misplace them. They shine, but for how long?

![Cleanded and polished screws and washers](/assets/posts/caligraph-2/2x/IMG_5800.jpg){:standalone}

I cleaned the wood (I am told it's balsa) with a damp cloth, as there is a lot of dirt on it. After drying, I am applying some English Oil on it. I am not sure whether this is the best thing to do. I am told that it's better if the wood is not left dry. But I guess it had some kind of finish or protection originally, although I am not sure what. The effect of English Oil is temporary. I am not sure if I should apply some other finish.

This picture shows the typebars about halfway through the process. You can see how bad they look.

![Unappetizing typebars](/assets/posts/caligraph-2/2x/IMG_5829.jpg){:standalone}

## The typebar rest

The typebar rest padding is in bad shape. The original material is not restorable. I need to scrape it, clean the metal parts, and then put some new material, like felt, or leather.

![The typebar rest](/assets/posts/caligraph-2/2x/IMG_5774.jpg){:standalone}

## The top plate

The top plate is attached to the bottom of the frame by four screws. I was not planning to remove it, but just in doubt I put some Kroil on a screw, and eventually managed to loosen it. Eventually, the other three came off too. But I made mistakes and damaged the slots of three of the screws. One reason is that there was still paint at the bottom of the slot. But I wish I could learn to be even more careful with slots! The good news is that this is only cosmetic. I might be able to hide the damage a little, or even find new screws if needed. In addition, the original screws were painted black.

![Damaged screw due to my carelessness](/assets/posts/caligraph-2/2x/IMG_5825.jpg){:standalone}

I managed to get the 72 basket screws without any damage (but some slots have marks of previous clumsy servicing).

With this, the top plate can be removed once the basket is empty. This is good because it means it can be separately painted and pinstriped.

![After removing a screw](/assets/posts/caligraph-2/2x/IMG_5826.jpg){:standalone}

Here is the removed top plate.

xxx TODO IMG

I also unscrewed the xxx pins, cleaned them and polished them.

## Pinstripes

As mentioned earlier, painting and the pinstripes are some unknowns. But paint, I can consider having that done professionally if I fail to do it myself. It's harder for pinstripes. The good news is that typewriters are not the only products of industrial design that had or have pinstripes: cars and motorcycles also do, and they have fairly large and current communities of enthusiasts. This also means that there are pinstriping products out there, including:

- vinyl pinstripes that you just lay down and cut
- stencils, which you apply, then paint over, and remove
- pinstriping tools for freehand pinstripes
- pinstripe decals (although I haven't researched this much yet)

The Caligraph 2's pinstripes were painted, as far as I can tell. This is also the case on the Remington 2 and 6. This is different from the Royal 5, for example, which look like decals. The simplest method might be to use stencils and paint. For less than $50 I can get all I need and I can experiment before doing it on the machine itself.

One issue is the width of the pinstripes. I have seen restored Caligraphs with pinstripes that were obviously too wide. Here, measuring with a caliper, I think the size is between 1/32" (2/64") and 3/64", but almost certainly smaller than 1/16" (4/64"). I don't think I can find 3/64" stencils, so I will probably give the 1/32" stencils and see how that goes.

Most of the pinstripes on the Caligraph 2 are straight, with a few curves. I am hoping that the stencils can handle that.

The pinstripes were probably golden. There is a small portion that is better preserved, as it was behind the protective shield of the space levers. It looks more plain yellow than gold, but it's hard to tell.

## The spring

I cleaned the main spring rod. It looks good now!

The original spring was broken. I noticed after cleaning that it was painted black.

## Disassembling the frame

Once all the keys, key levers, typebars, spring rod, and top plate are gone, you can remove:

- the front reed bar
- the space levers
- the back reed bar
- the rocker bar
- the universal bar (disconnecting it from the rocker bar)

Remains the bottom of the frame. The left and right sides are held together by the front frame rod, and the back frame brace.

The two screws holding the front frame rod can be removed. There were paint residues on them, so I used paint stripper first. The difficulty is to also remove the paint in the screw slots: if you don't do this, the screwdriver will slip and damage the slot. In spite of doing this, I slipped once. Darn.



xxx remove those

The bottom of the machine is now as disassembled as can reasonably be!

## Processing the frame

The parts of the frame need to be:

- cleaned
- derusted
- stripped
- sanded
- filled
- primed
- painted
- pinstriped
- clear coated

Now this is for me the most worrying part.

## Replating

After cleaning the hangers, washers, key levers, turnbuckles, and connecting rods, I realized that they look good enough, and I don't think they need plating. This is good news, as that would have been a lot of work. Like on many of these old upstrikes, the basket linkages look plain, but that's ok as long as they don't start rusting. In fact, I am unclear whether these parts were plated at all or if they were just polished metal.

2020-07-20: I wasn't sure the connecting rods were plated, but on a few of them, there was clear plating peeling.

This means that there will be way less to replate than I originally thought.

The marginal stops thumb screws cleaned well, but I think they are down to bare metal but based on other pictures, in particular from [Martin Howard's site](https://www.antiquetypewriters.com/typewriter/calligraph-2/), they were originally plated. The same goes for most carriage parts.

## Caligraph terminology

Often I don't know what to call a certain part. But with the Caligraph 2, it's easy: we have a list of most parts and their original names!

TODO: pics!

- top plate
- wooden lever + lever spring
- bridge
- hangers, washers, key levers, turnbuckles, and connecting rods

(If you were thrown back to around 1880, you couldn't says that the Caligraph was a "typewriter". [FIXME: there is an ad saying "the Caligraph typewriter"!] That was still a proper noun owned by Remington or, rather, the "xxx company". So this introduced competition between the "Type Writer" and the "Caligraph". If the latter had been truly successful, as others have suggested, people might have refered to those machines as caligraphs. "What kind of caligraph is your office using?" But maybe "typewriter" was too catchy, and "caligraph" would have been too close to the word "calligraphy". (In most languges, the typewriter was known as "writing machine".))
