## Introduction

In October 2013, as part of a quest to know more about the origins of the modern piano keyboard, I set as a goal to read a book by Jean Perrot about the early history of the *pipe organ*.[^perrot]

![Jean Perrot's book](/assets/posts/early-history-of-the-organ/perrot.jpg){:standalone width="50%"}

It took me about four months to finish it, relatively leisurely, after which I started writing an article about what I learned. I then left the draft untouched until 2021![^meanwhile]

You migh think that this is an obscure topic! However, there is a lot of fascinating information in this solid book. This article attempts to summarize some key takeaways.

## An old instrument

It turns out that the pipe organ[^organon] is an *ancient* instrument, dating back to the third century BCE, or about 2,300 years ago. If this alone is not amazing enough, many of the parts that constitute a modern organ were already in place right from the beginning, including:

- neatly aligned *pipes* ordered by size
- a *keyboard* with springs, actuated with the fingers
- an air pressure *regulator*
- air *pumps*

## Sources of evidence

There is surviving evidence about the early organ:

- Two main texts about the Greco-Roman organ have been copied and preserved over the millennia: one by [Vitruvius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitruvius) (1st century BCE), and one by [Hero of Alexandria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero_of_Alexandria) (1st century CE).
- Treatises from the 10th and 11th centuries detail organ building during the Middle Ages.
- Iconographic evidence has survived in the form of mosaics, bas-reliefs, and other sculptures.
- Archaeological evidence has been found, in particular the small [Aquincum organ][aquincum-organ-link] and the [Dion hydraulis][dion-hydraulis-link] (found in 1992 and dating back to the 1st century BCE!).

## The inventor

The organ was, as far as we know, single-handedly invented by one person, [Ktesibios][ktesibios-link] (or Ctesibius), an early "geek" who had a passion for building machines with pumps. Ktesibios lived around  285â€“222 BCE.

For the organ, Ktesibios had to devise a system capable not only of pumping air, but of maintaining a reasonably constant air pressure so that the sound would remain even and pleasant when playing sequences of notes.

To achieve this, Ktesibios came up with a system which included a pump pushing air through a cistern, within which the weight of water regulated the air pressure. Because of the role of water, the instrument was called *hydraulis* (from the greek for "water", and the wind instrument "aulos"), and is also referred to as a *hydraulic organ*.

The ancient Greeks already had wind instruments such as the aulos, a sort of flute. In this case, the source of the air pressure was a human player's lungs. But using a machine to blow air was a novelty. In fact, all the mechanical parts of the ancient hydraulis were breakthroughs, including:

xxxx this and list above kind of duplicate xxx

- the air pump, which was Ktesibios's specialty,
- the pressure regulator (using water),
- the wind chest (the box where the air is distributed the pipes),
- and last but not least, the keyboard.

Ktesibios described his invention in a book, now unfortunately lost. But his legacy was preserved at least in part in Vitruvius and Hero's texts. While we don't have their original manuscripts anymore, we have copies made over the centuries. One of the most amazing pieces of evidence is a drawing from a copy of Hero's Pneumatics from around 1250, in greek, showing all the details of the organ. It is likely that the original manuscript from about 2,000 years ago already had similar drawings.[^hero-drawing]

This diagram, originally in three colors, is amazing: it shows the keys from the keyboard, with springs and sliders, the windchest, the pipes, the air pump and, of course, the pressure regulator (the cistern with an inverted funnel, at the bottom left of the illustration).

![Diagram from Hero's Pneumatics in the Venice Manuscript from 1250](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ebruchez/public/master/Reading/images/Hero's%20Pneumatics%20manuscript%20600.jpg){:standalone}

Now of course all of this is terribly old history, and the sources are scarce. Vitruvius and Hero described the instrument centuries after Ktesibios lived. So we cannot know for certain whether Ktesibios invented all of this by himself, or based his work on previous knowledge and attempts. But as far as we know, reportedly, he invented the first organ.

## The Greco-Roman organ

Rapidly after its invention the organ developed beyond the prototype stage, reached maturity and spread through the Greco-Roman world. The instrument typically had two pumps and between 7 and 18 pipes in a given rank, with up to 4 ranks of pipes. We can guess that the interval between two notes ranged from about a semitone to a tone.

This instrument remained in use for many centuries throughout the Greco-Roman period.

## Misconceptions about the role of water

From the antiquity to modern days, the exact role of water in the hydraulis has been confusing if not mysterious to many, and misconceptions have been common. Between the 16th and the 19th century in particular there have been quite a few creative, although sometimes beautiful, attempts at describing and representing hydraulic organs.

The role played by water in the hydraulis is quite easy to understand if you look at the instrument or a proper diagram of it. Vitruvius himself [wrote](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/20239/20239-h/29239-h.htm#Page_299):

> With my best efforts I have striven to set forth an obscure subject clearly in writing, but the theory of it is not easy, nor readily understood by all, save only those who have had some practice in things of this kind. If anybody has failed to understand it, he will certainly find, when he comes to know the thing itself, that it is carefully and exquisitely contrived in all respects.

Here are a few common misconceptions:

- __Misconception 1: The water was a power source.__ False: the hydraulis  was human powered (often by children, pumping with their arms using levers).
- __Misconception 2: The water was going through the pipes to produce sound.__ False, of course: the hydraulis produced sound like any organ: with *air* flowing through the pipes.
- __Misconception 3: A constant supply of water was needed.__ False: the *amount* of water was constant: you just needed enough water to fill the cistern, and to refill it when there was loss due to evaporation or leaks. It is the *weight* of the water which was used to regulate the air pressure. This made the hydraulis a relatively mobile instrument.

## What the water actually did

Imagine connecting a manual tire pump directly to a flute: because the pump requires a back and forth movement, air flows in through the flute only intermittently. You cannot produce a steady sound this way. If you use two pumps in alternance (and most hydraulis had two pumps), you can probably mitigate the effect a bit, but odds are that the sound will still be uneven.

In the hydraulis, the water is used as part of a mechanism to regulate air pressure so that the organist can play notes continuously, possibly even holding notes for a while, without too much variation in the intensity of the sound.

In the hydraulis, air is pushed through pipes and also goes to an inverted funnel or dome (called the pnigeus) submerged in water.

![Pnigeus](/assets/posts/early-history-of-the-organ/pnigeus.jpg){:standalone width="50%"}

This creates a reserve of air. When the pump piston goes back and no more air is pushed in by the pump, the weight of the water surrounding the pnigeus pushes that air up through the windchdest and pipes. This way, even when the pump is inactive, the organ can produce sound, at least for an instant. In the illustration below, you can see how the water (11) and pnigeus (12) relate to the regular path of the air through the hydraulis.

![Modern diagram of Vitruvius's organ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ebruchez/public/master/Reading/images/Vitruvius's%20Organ%20600.png){:standalone}

## The introduction of bellows

It is unclear exactly when *bellows organs* (which didn't need any water at all to operate) were invented. Bellows themselves are a very old invention (probably at least 3,000 years old). But the bellows organ, for the same reasons that applied to the hydraulis, also needed a pressure regulator, which had to be invented. We know that by the second century CE bellows organs were in use, and that by the time the Western Roman Empire fell, the hydraulis had disappeared.[^bellows-hydraulic]

Bellows organs had the benefit of being lighter and easier to move around. They also required less maintenance due to the absence of water.

However they were initially much less powerful than the hydraulis, probably due to the difficulty of regulating air pressure. So bellow organs at first served different purposes, and were more likely to be used inside buildings rather than outside.

## Who played the organ?

There is a legend that Ktesibios's wife was the first organist. Whether that is true or not, there is evidence that there were women organists.

Playing the organ required practice and skill, especially since you could play the antique organ with individual fingers, not just full hands. It is also likely that some kind of polyphony was already common, in other words that the performer would use his two hands to play, making the task that much more skilled.

## The organ and religious music in Greco-Roman times

In the antiquity, the organ was *not used for religious service at all* as far as we know. Instead it was used in the circus for gladiatorial combats, as one thing the hydraulic organ was known for was its loudness (using reed pipes)!

![Hydraulis in the Zliten mosaic](/assets/posts/early-history-of-the-organ/zliten.jpg){:standalone}

The organ was also known for its ability to provide charming, soft, beautiful sounds, when using softer flue pipes. For this reason it became a favorite instrument of emperors, starting with Nero, and this is probably part of what make the organ appealing to religious uses at a later time.

## How the organ made it to modern times

After the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century, the organ disappeared completely from the Western world for about 3 centuries. It is in Constantinople, in the Byzantine Empire, that the Greco-Roman organ was preserved during that time.

In Constantinople, the organ was used at the imperial court as well as an outdoors instrument for big celebrations. There were "silver" organs and "golden" organs, the latter presumably the Emperor's personal property.

It doesn't look like the organ made it to the church at all during that period either, as the Christian clergy remained generally opposed to instrumental music.

The organ made it to Baghdad, probably during the 8th century, where it remained known for centuries, and even, in a single documented instance, to China, as a gift to [Kublai Khan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kublai_Khan) in the 13th century. That's the same Kublai Khan that Marco Polo says he visited.

![Kublai Khan](/assets/posts/early-history-of-the-organ/kublai.jpg){:standalone width="50%"}

During its Byzantine period, the organ didn't seem to evolve much if at all, remaining identical to the Roman bellows organ.

The organ returned to the Western world, specifically to France, in the middle of 8th century, when an instrument was shipped from Constantinople to [Pepin the Short](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pepin_the_Short), king of the Franks. This organ was a gift from Emperor Constantine V (emperor from 741 to 775), no doubt for political reasons.

![Pepin the Short](/assets/posts/early-history-of-the-organ/pepin.jpg){:standalone width="50%"}

There are accounts of the arrival of the instrument, which impressed a lot: nobody knew about the Greco-Roman organ anymore by then.

About 50 years after the arrival of this instrument, in 826, an organ builder and priest, called Georgius (or Gregorius) arrived from Venice at Louis the Pious's (Charlemagne's son) court, where he was tasked to build organs. He was probably trained in Constantinople, and was the first known organ builder in the West since about 5 centuries. The purpose of the instrument was, again, not for religious service, but likely to attempt to rival with the Constantinople court. The instrument was likely played outdoors rather than indoors.

To summarize the amazing voyage of the organ so far, paraphrasing Perrot:

> The organ traveled from Egypt in a Greek milieu to the entire Roman world, survived in Constantinople, and finally came back to Europe's Frankish kingdom.

## How the organ made it to the church

Georgius's influence helped change the attitude of the church regarding instrumental music. He passed his knowledge to pupils. Building organs required skill, and monks were well positioned to learn and build instruments. The organ was initially tolerated and then became in common use (not necessarily to everybody's liking). Even the pope got interested in the instrument, and there is evidence of organs all over Europe in the 9th and 10th century.

## From the 10th to the 13th century

No instruments from the 10th and 11th centuries have survived to this day, but fairly detailed treatises on organ-building from that time remain. This means that we know quite a bit about how organs were built at that time.

We know, for example, that there were some steps back from the Greco-Roman organ described by Vitruvius. In particular, not all organs had proper keyboards: some had simple sliders, that you had to pull to allow air to flow through the pipes, and push back to interrupt the sound. This system had to be more difficult and slower to play than a keyboard with keys and springs. Also, many of the instruments were smaller than the Greco-Roman organ. This can be explaind by two factors:

- a loss of the Greco-Roman tradition
- the relative poverty of the times compared to the peak of the Roman Empire

![Organ with sliders (Harding bible, early 12th century)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ebruchez/public/master/Reading/images/Harding%20Bible%20300.jpg){:standalone}

In passing, there is a description of a huge organ for the time, allegedly built in the 10th century in Winchester, England. That organ is reported to have had 400 pipes, 40 sliders, and 26 bellows operated by 70 men (there was no electricity or even steam power back then). The organ might have covered more than 3 octaves. All the evidence comes from a poem, and this unlikely instrument might never have existed.[^winchester]

In spite of these setbacks, there was progress on other fronts. For example, the poem describing the Winchester organ marks the first time that keys (here sliders) are reported to be identified by letters.

We also know the following about organs of this period:

- Pipes could be conical or cylindrical and were made of copper and soldered with tin.
- Practical tuning of pipes was described in treatises. [xxxx TODO like?]
- Some organs did have actual keyboards made of wooden keys reinforced with iron.
- The wind-chest was made of wood and/or copper.
- There were ram-skin bellows which would provide the air pressure.
- Bellows could be noisy to the point of distracting from the music.
- The organs were often placed in the church under an arch, and the organist would not be visible (which is very different from the Greco-Roman setup where the organist was facing the action taking place in the arena).
- The diatonic scale was a given, with some extras, like the B-flat.

By the 13th century, the organ had become essentially a church instrument, but there were smaller portable (for secular use) and moveable (so-called "positives") instruments. Most drawings that have survived show small portable instruments.

During that time the organ could be played as a solo instrument, but also with singers, and alongside other instruments, including the cymbalum, a instrument made of up to 8 bells which often appears in illustrations.

It is very likely that the organ influenced the development of polyphony (the practice of playing multiple melodic lines) during that time.

## About the origins of the keyboard

The most stunning fact to me is that the Greco-Roman hydraulis, as described by Hero of Alexandria, indeed featured something we would today immediately recognize as a music keyboard. The invention is at least 2,000 years-old, and likely goes back to Ktesibios, about 2,300 years ago.

The mechanism of this early keyboard is known thanks to Hero's description. It had:

- sliders which could slide into the wind-chest under each pipe,
- cranks revolving around an axis, which would push the sliders into the wind-chest, to let air pass through pipes,
- the keys proper
- horn spatulas acting as springs, connected with gut to the sliders, which would pull the sliders back to close the air path.

![Basic layout of a key](/assets/posts/early-history-of-the-organ/key-and-wind-chest.jpg){:standalone}

This mechanism has been replicated in modern reconstructions of the hydraulis.

The keys were approximately horizontal and had to be depressed, and had springs to put them back in their original position, as is the case with a modern organ or piano (although the latter don't use springs but another mechanism to put back the keys in horizontal position).

We don't have as much information about the early keyboard as we could wish. Representations of the Greco-Roman organs tended to show the instrument from the front, showing the decorated instrument case, the beautiful pipes, and the organist facing the observer. This means that the keyboard was typically hidden behind the instrument, and artists didn't think it useful to represent it.

However, we do have information in addition to Hero's text:

- The Aquincum organ, from the 3rd century CE, shows the mechanism described by Hero, with return springs made of bronze, and keys made of wood and reinforced in bronze.
- A text by Porfyrius Optatianus from the 4th century mentions "a line of square-shaped keys whereby the musician's hand opens and shuts in time the openings for the air" and keys "which ever tremble to the slightest touch".
- Julian the Apostate, also in the the 4th century, mentions a "man with nimble fingers stands there manipulating the keys which give voice to the pipes".
- Senator Cassiodorus, in the middle of the 6th century, mentions "wooden keys".
- A lamp at a Carthage museum shows the keyboard, with 18 oblong and relatively broad keys.
- The "Rusticus" organ, depicted in a church near Rome, has "15 keys longer than that broad, laying close together as in the modern manual".
- The Winchester organ, from the 10th century, had letters inscribed on each key or slider.
- In the 13th century, the [Rutland Psalter][rutland-link] shows an organist playing with this fingers.

![The Rutland Psalter showing playing with the fingers](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ebruchez/public/master/Reading/images/Rutland%20psalter.png){:standalone width="75%"}

Something I find particularly interesting is that the trebles (the "high notes", which require shorter pipes) are almost always shown to the *right* of the organist, as is the case on a modern piano keyboard. One could imagine that this was simply a choice, and that many instruments would feature the opposite layout.

It is a bit unclear whether this is simply a tradition (the author of the book seems to think it is arbitrary), or whether this real benefits to having high notes played with right hand. And I can see how that could be the case, given that most people are right-handed, and that's melodies might favor high notes over low notes.

PICTURE OF ORGANIST FROM THE FRONT

While we know quite a bit about the mechanism, we don't know much about the construction of the keyboard, or its appearance, and we must guess some of this. But the iconographic evidence shows convincingly that organists were sittings with their hands over the keyboard, and yes, their two hands. It is clear that the keyboard on those instruments could be played with the fingers, instead of whole hands (as might have been the case with some medieval organs with sliders). We don't know of the exact hand or finger positions.

The antique keyboard was already fairly similar to that of a modern piano, but without the black keys. The keys had to face the pipes, because each key had to push or pull the slider that would let the air go through a given pipe. The keys were further apart compared to a modern piano, and spaced about 5-7 cm (about 2-3 inches)

There is evidence in the texts that a lot of dexterity was required to play those instruments (the keys "tremble to the slightest touch"). We can imagine that the level of skill was not comparable to that required on a modern instrument, but the reputation of virtuosity and difficulty was there ("this called for real virtuosity: [â€¦] 'nimble fingers' [â€¦] 'straying' [â€¦] 'Masterly fingers' [â€¦] sliders 'Continuously in motion'").

Based on all the evidence, Jean Perrot says that "The piano keyboard [â€¦] derives directly from that of the Greco-Roman organ, and the position of the hands on that primitive manual probably contributed in no small measure to the evolution of polyphonic music."

As the tradition of the Greco-Roman organ eroded after the fall of the Western Roman Empire and it survival in the East, some details of the construction of organs were lost. There is no evidence, it seems, of Roman organs with plain sliders. But clearly, based on texts and drawings, some medieval organs had lost the Greco-Roman keyboard and plain sliders were used.

Still, some organs had proper keyboards, which are described as made of wood with iron reinforcements.

However, by the 13th century, keyboards remained extremely simple, and only saw developments during the following centuries. This should be the subject of another article.
