## Background

Back in September 2018, I saw an Oliver 5 for sale a few hours away for a good price. We took a family trip and we got the machine, which came complete with base, cover, manuals. And it had its two ribbon spool covers as well! It was sold by a really nice 98 year-old gentleman, who said the machine had been his father's. I love this kind of history! This became my acquisition number 45.

## Dating

The machine is from about 1911-1912 based on its 255684 serial number.

I read that the backspace was "added about 282,000 approximately 1911." My serial is under that, and my machine does not have a backspace key, so I think that it would be from 1911.

## Restoration

The machine was very dusty and grimy, in spite of having a cover.

Also, it didn't work. It obviously had a broken draw cord.

But was anything else broken?

I got started on it the initial dusting and disassembly.

I polished the bell.

I removed parts on the back of the machine to clean them and under them. There was a lot of caked dirt there.

I noticed soon that, unfortunately, one of the escapement wheel's teeth was broken.

![Broken escapement tooth](/assets/posts/restoring-oliver5/2x/IMG_0939.jpg){:standalone}

This would prevent the machine from working properly. Luckily, I found a kind typewriter collector who provided me with a replacement part. I removed the "spaceship" assembly and replaed the wheel. Success!

## Spring

I did a few more tasks, when I noticed that the spring was broken in two places.

![Broken spring](/assets/posts/restoring-oliver5/2x/IMG_1001.jpg){:standalone}

I considered fixing it: grinding a hole at the end of the non-broken part. But I believe I was told it might break again. I was also directed to look at clock springs. I started looking, but other things happened and the project was paused in February 2019.

In the meanwhile, I acquired a couple of parts Oliver 9 machines. It dawned on me way not long ago that maybe one of them might have an intact spring. One of the machines was missing the spring box, but the other one had it with an intact spring! I checked whether the spring was compatible, and it was. The Oliver 5 and 9 have identical spring boxes. I transferred the spring to the Oliver 5 spring box, which, while not looking perfect, was in better condition. Then I figured I would just complete the cleaning and restoration.

## Carriage

In 2018-2019, I had started disassembling the carriage and I cleaned a few parts. The paper fingers came out better than anticipated:

but I had not completed the task. So I finished this first.

## Removing rust

I put a number of rusted parts in Evapo-Rust. I even dunked the entire "spaceship":

It came out pretty nice:

## The base

This Oliver 5 came with a base. Looking at TWDB for reference, about 20% of Oliver 5 machines appear to have a base. I don't know if all machines that had a base also necessarily had a cover, as mine does.

But the base was in poor cosmetic shape. That means it has "history" and "personality" but also, well, it's just plain ugly.

What to do? To restore or not to restore? This can be controversial. I think that you could make the case either way. The Oliver 5 is not a rare machine, but one with a base is slightly more rare. Still, it's definitely not unique.

I have recently restored the base of my Model-121 Vertical Adder.

![The Model-121 base board after applying Danish oil](/assets/posts/restoring-oliver5/2x/IMG_2823.jpg){:standalone}

I also have a Smith Premier 2 which has a base in really good condition. I don't think I would restore that one, for example, as it is in really good condition.

![Smith Premier 2 with original base](/assets/posts/restoring-oliver5/2x/IMG_7290.jpg){:standalone}

In any case, I decided that to restore the Oliver 5's base. After removing the screws (see below), I sanded it with 80 grit first. I discovered that the base is made of oak. The wood was in quite good condition underneath the dust, grime, and coating.

Then I sanded two sides more aggressively, as the wood had expanded and some parts of the board were no longer aligned. I also used wood filler to fill the biggest holes. Here, my lack of skill is obvious. For the 121, I had just used existing wood filler. I figured I would be smarter this time and mix sawdust from the sanding, glue, and make my own filler. So I did, but the result was not great: the filler ended up having the clear color of the glue, which I didn't like. I tried to patch things up with the original filler, but I think it is a little too clear. Also, I only figured later that it would be a good idea to use masking tape before filling. Live and learn - although I am still not sure how to make my own wood filler, even though the videos appear to make it sound so easy.

![Masking tape to try to fix things](/assets/posts/restoring-oliver5/2x/IMG_5071.jpg){:standalone}

After that, I sanded the board down to 120, 220, and 400. I then applied a few coats of natural Danish oil. However, I was really not happy with the result, which was too dark, and highlighted imperfections in the wood. I would have preferred a finish as close as possible as the original natural wood as possible. In fact, I would leave the board without any finish whatsoever as I like the look of the freshly sanded wood. But I think that it needs some protection.

So I decided to re-sand the board. Luckily, that removed the Danish oil finish, even though the oak has large pores. After researching finishes, I figured that water-based matte polyurethane might be the closest I can get to natural wood: it's very clear, it doesn't darken the wood much, it protects it, and it gives the wood a nice sheen. So I watched a few videos and bought some Varathane polyurethane.

![The product](/assets/posts/restoring-oliver5/2x/IMG_5111.jpg){:standalone}

I practiced a little on a piece of 2x4. I was really happy with what I saw, so I immediately went ahead with doing the board. I applied 4 coats of the product (3 only on the bottom). You only have to wait 2 hours between coats. Then a quick scuffing with 400 grit sandpaper, tack cloth, and you can do the next coat. You have to brush it with a really good brush and go slowly, but it's not really hard. I am really happy with the result. It makes the oak look really nice.

![Close-up of the surface](/assets/posts/restoring-oliver5/2x/IMG_5126.jpg){:standalone}

Here is the finished board. I does look restored, that's certain, or even modern. But I like the natural, clean look and the constrast with the machine on top which, while clean, shows the passing of time. In short, I couldn't be happier with the look of the board now. I didn't think, when I started restoring it, that I would get such a nice result.

Interestingly, the base was originally not manufactured perfectly. In particular, the left and right holes are not at the same distance to the sides of the board. I don't think the base was meant to be looking perfect in the first place, unlike the machine itself. It was also meant to be painted, so I don't think that the manufacturer took care of picking the best-looking pieces of wood necessarily. But it turns out that the oak, once sanded and coated, looks really nice! And that was really a good surprise.

## Bluing

The base has 4 screws, 2 on each side. The cover of the machine attaches to those. In order to sand the board, I decided to try to remove them. It turned out to be easy.

![The screws before bluing](/assets/posts/restoring-oliver5/2x/IMG_5038.jpg){:standalone}

I cleaned them, and then figured I would try cold bluing them as I had just acquired a bluing solution. Cold bluing is a method that turns some metals blue or, in fact, black. The black is some kind of oxide that protects the surface from rust. Using the cold method does not offer as much protection as the hot method, in which you heat up the part and then drench it in oil. So cold bluing is often done more for cosmetic reason than anything else. Still, it does offer some level of protection in addition to the cosmetic aspect.

So I went for it. I Dremeled the screws, cleaned them, dried them, applied the bluing solution as per [this video](), which calls for letting the parts covered in oil overnight after that. The result is fine I believe. I used Super Blue, which gets you the darker color. Wear gloves, eye protection, etc. for using this product.

## Polishing and waxing

I cleaned all painted parts with Simple Green. The paint on this machine is in varying condition. Some is chipped, some is wrinkled, some has marks of corrosion, and some is really pretty good. I did not plan to repaint this machine. At most, I could still do some touch-ups, but for now, the chips and corroded parts stay.

The parts with the large decals are the hardest to handle, because there was dirt and corrosion around and on them. This applies to the paper table and the front cover.

As you know, decals are fragile. You can easily scratch them or remove their gold color. So I first started cleaning around them as much as I could. I also used rubbing compound around. For the front cover, I used q-tips with water and a little bit of detergent to clean over the decals themselves. I compared with pictures to make sure I was not doing too much damage. Still, it's hard to clean around them. I completed with polish around the decals, but I still have trouble applying that. I need to look into other polishing products.

I figured I would try waxing the paper table. I've had poor experience with Renaissance wax. But this time, it worked fairly well. It doesn't hide defect but makes things shinier and protects what's underneath. I think the result is acceptable. I did the same for the front cover, and eventually I applied this to the whole machine, although to be fair, it doesn't do much on the parts where the paint is in poor condition. But it doesn't seem to hurt. This said, I still think there are ways to do a better job at cleaning this paint and around the decals, as well as polishing.

## Towers

The towers were in decent shape, but the shields had clearly bent.

![The shields are clearly out of shape](/assets/posts/restoring-oliver5/2x/IMG_0957.jpg){:standalone}

I took them out and straightened them as well as I could.

## Feet

I had sets of Oliver feet which I bought from a collector a while back.

![New feet](/assets/posts/restoring-oliver5/2x/IMG_5065.jpg){:standalone}

The feet on this machine were hard but otherwise ok. Did I need to replace them? I considered keeping the original feet, since the machine would rest on its base anyway most of the time. But when trying the machine on the base, I realized that it was sinking too much into the cups, because the feet had obviously flattened over time.

![The old feet are too flat](/assets/posts/restoring-oliver5/2x/IMG_5043.jpg){:standalone}

So my options were either to put some rounds at the bottom of the cups to make them less shallow, or to replace the feet. This machine deserves new feet, so I replaced them, and they are tall enough so that the machine's frame doesn't touch the base.

![The new feet allow for some clearance](/assets/posts/restoring-oliver5/2x/IMG_5057.jpg){:standalone}

In addition, this allows you to use the machine off its base as well, as the new feet offer protection for a table and help with slipping.

Tips: To remove the old feet, I just used pliers, which, surprisingly, allowed the old feet to come out intact instead of crumbling. I Dremeled the holes quickly. I applied oil to the new feet's shafts so that they would slide in place. They fit really snugly.

## Adjusting the line feed

The Oliver has an interesting feature. Most typewriters, starting with the Remington 2, use a lever for the carriage return. But on the Oliver, the towers stand in front of the carriage, so a lever wouldn't work. Instead, you push the left platen knob to return the carriage. When the carriage hits its end, the platen turns automatatically (with single, double, or triple spacing). When putting things back tegether, I didn't line the gears properly, so I was getting 1 1/2 line, and then mid-line the platen would rotate one way or the other.

Once I understood how this should work, I adjusted this by putting the selector in position 3 first, then aligning the gears.

## Adjusting the ribbon vibrator

I found that the ribbon vibrator didn't push forward enough, so when shifting to "FIG", the ribbon overlapped with the type. I adjusted the nuts so that it would move a little further. But if it's too much, then the escapement can't trip!

## Resulting condition

The base is now in great condition! I would say that the machine is now in good condition, but it's not perfect. The paint and plating got cleaned and polished but that's all, and they show the defects of age. I think one thing that could be done is to fix the paint chips at some point. But it's not striclty needed, and the paint color would have to match perfectly. There are a few spots under and behind the carriage where rust is stil apparent. The keys levers could be cleaned more. A better result could have been obtained by fully disassembling the machine, but it was not truly needed. So, it's a compromise, but not a bad one.

The machine types well. I still had occasional issues with the leftmost keys not triggering the escapement occasionally. That's something to look into. A new platen would help with typing, and would also protect the types during impact. I have used two backing sheets, but that's not the same.

xxx It is tricky and I can't claim I have the best way. I first start cleaning everything avoiding the decals with Simple Green diluted with water. Then the difficulty is when you get closer to the decals. I tried to get as close as I could without touching them. Then I used q-tips with a small amount of liquid to gently rub over the decals and remove the grime on it, keeping a close eye on them to make sure they do not get visible damage. I also used rubbing compound and polish on the paint, and again, it's tricky when getting close to the decals. In the end I went over them softly anyway.
