## The story

Back in December 2018 I acquired, in a little bidding war, a Fay-Sholes No. 7 typewriter from a Swiss auction site. I had it shipped to my parents and in summer 2019 I finally had a chance to get my hands on the machine, which I planned to take with me back to California.

## The history

xxx more from Martin Howard https://www.antiquetypewriters.com/typewriter/remington-sholes-typewriter/

The Fay-Sholes is a machine created by Franklin Remington (from the Remington family) and Zalmon G. Sholes (one of the several sons of Christopher Latham Sholes). They created a company in 1894 and called their machine the Rem-Sho. The first model had really nicely sculpted greek temple columns and a copper-plated color. They are very much sought after by collectors.

After a lawsuit from Wyckoff, Seamans & Benedict (whose names you can see on the Remington 6 and 7, in particular), the company was renamed Fay-Sholes in 1901 (Fay being the president and main owner of the company). The company lasted for less than a decade after that, allowing it to produce a front-strike design, later acquired by Japy.

These machines are also known as Remington-Sholes, Fay-Sholes, Fay-Sho, and Rem-Sho. xxxx clarify

The Fay-Sholes 6 and 7 (for the international market) introduced a more plain, black, and less sculpted design. They are arguably not as beautiful as the original Rem-Sho. However, it's all relative, and I think that they remain incredibly beautiful machines!

## Transport

To transport the machine, I first removed its carriage, which I padded in bubble-wrap and put in a suitcase. I took the main typewriter body, with some minimal protection, as a carry-on my flight back to California. The whole machine made it home without a scratch. The carry-on weighed close to 26 lbs (almost 12 kg), 21.1 lbs (9.5 kg) being the body of the Fay-Sholes. No questions were asked at security or otherwise.

I could tell that the paint and chrome of the machine were in pretty good condition under the dust.

I spent a little bit of time cleaning it up and polishing it, and it is a really beautiful machine now.

## Dating

It is unclear when exactly models 6 and 7 were introduced, but it's probably around 1900.

I haven't been able to date it very precisely but Remington-Sholes / Fay-Sholes / Fay-Sho / Rem-Sho were made between 1896 and 1909 and the Fay-Sholes name likely appeared in 1901 at the earliest. See [Fay-Sholes at The Virtual Typewriter Museum](https://www.typewritermuseum.org/collection/brands/index.php3?machine=faysho&cat=ku).



## What's special about the Fay-Sholes

The Fay-Sholes's main particularity, besides the famous names behind its backers, is that it is a *basket-shift upstrike*! When you use the shift key, the entire basket moves from back to front (and back again) while the carriage doesn't move at all. This is different from the design of upstrikes like the Remington 6 or 7 and earlier, where shifting moves part of the carriage from front to back (and back again).

For regular frontstrike machines, a basket shift is typically lighter to use than a carriage shift - because the carriage tends to have more mass than the basket. This is why all typewriters ended up using a basket shift. But having this feature in an upstrike machine is definitely unusual!

The Fay-Sholes No. 7 only has a left-hand shift key, but the basket-shift is very light, and using the left hand to shift is therefore less of a problem. You can easily do a shift-S, for example, with your left hand. I would prefer an additional shift key on the right, but it's not too bad as is.

The inside of the machine feels very roomy. In many ways, the Fay-Sholes looks like an improved Remington 6 or 7: it features metal key levers instead of wooden ones, the key lever springs in the back are neatly organized on a metal bar, and generally things feel tighter than on a Remington 6 or 7.

I found the serial number under the carriage. This requires removing the carriage, which is very easy: just remove the two screws, one on the left and one on the right side.

## The escapement

The escapement doesn't use a star wheel like many machines do. Instead, the escapement xxx.

## The weaknesses

On the other hand, it doesn't look like it features an automatic ribbon reverse mechanism, or an automatic way of moving the ribbon front-to-back, two features present on the Remington 6 as well as the Smith Premier 2. You can move the ribbon forward/backward with a knob on the right side of the machine. I still need to verify exactly how this works.

It would still be good to have a right-hand shift key.

## A missing part?

I just found out that the machine might be missing a vertical rod in front, right under the character indicator. The purpose of this is to prevent the key levers from moving when reaching the right margin. The character indicator is lifted, its back lowered, therefore pushing down the rod, which pushes another bar that blocks the key levers. This part appears missing on the few pictures of Fay-Sholes 6 or 7 online. On the other hand it is present on other models (maybe model 4?). Could it be that the hardware was there on the 6/7 but the rod never installed? Or it might just have fallen off. This needs more research. Either way, it shouldn't be hard to build a replacement if needed.

## The keyboard

This machine has a Swiss-German QWERTZ keyboard, with a dead key for the circumflex and grave accents which also allows for writing in French or Italian. Interestingly enough, unlike most dead keys which you hit before the letter, here you hit the dead key *after*. So you type "e", which advances the carriage, then:"^", which writes on top of the previous letter without advancing the carriage! This is a fun way to do it as that means the typebar for the dead key must hit to the left of the normal position!

## Cleaning

The machine was, again, in good condition, but very dusty. I cleaned the dust and some level of dirt with a damp cloth, and used metal and car polish. I was surprised to see how well the polishing compound worked on the paint. I didn't use it everywhere, and certainly not on the decals and pinstripes.

In addition to remove the carriage, I removed other parts to facilitate cleaning, including several parts of the carriage. The chromed parts on the carriage are truly beautiful. I am sure you could do an even better job of polishing, but I am pretty happy with the current result already and I don't want to overdo it.

One of the dirtiest area was the top of the basket. I used some PB Blaster there to loosen the dirt.

## The typebar rest

That's the part on which the typebars, well, rest. In upstrike machines, this is a roundish part covered in felt or leather, which fits inside the basket.

I dislodged the typebar rest by removing the 4 screws that attach it. At first I though I wouldn't be able to take it out. But after I figured out that by flipping all the typebars up it would just slide out, I was happy!

![](/assets/posts/fay-sholes-7/2x/xxx){:standalone}

One reason for removing the typebar rest was to protect it from PB Blaster drops, cleaning it, and possibly replacing the leather. Once I realized it was very easy to remove it, I decided to, at least temporarily, leave it as is. It is black and hard, but it is still in one piece.

## Draw band

The draw band is made of leather, an interesting choice. On some of the older machines I have, such as the Remington 6 and the Smith Premier 2, the draw band is made of steel.

## The ribbon

I had an spare wide ribbon (1" 1/8) which I used. The original ribbon had a clip on the left side, and I used that clip to attach the "new" ribbon. However, the right side is not properly attached yet. Things work until you completely unwind the right spool, after that you need to switch the direction and make sure the ribbon winds correctly. That's something I'd like to address at some point.

## Pinstripes

The machine has some pinstripes in great condition, and some which have faded, especially closer to the front. This was already the case when I received the machine - I was very careful not to cause further removal of the pinstripes.

## Fixing the escapement

During cleaning, I noticed that the escapement was behaving erratically. The horizontal dented bar was moving up at each keystroke but not fully. After I typed a little with the machine, a nut that was holding it, and which I had removed and put back, just flew off. I then realized that the bar had been incorrectly adjusted. It did not properly swivel on its pivots. I took it out and adjusted it properly, and voila, the escapement now works seemingly as it should. I've had the occasional issue around position 22, so something might not be perfect yet, but it's already pretty good.

## Typing

xxx platen is hard, of course;

The quality of the print is pretty good. I suspect that this machine did not get that much use and abuse during its life so far. The alignment is not perfect: this is often an issue with early typewriters. You can try to align the typebars, but it is not easy without the appropriate tool.

I have now typed several pages with it.

For now I don't plan to replace the platen. It would be better to type with, but since these machines are more uncommon xxx

## Remaining works

- rod in the front
- attaching the ribbon
- figuring out the full story about the reverse/
- washer

## Conclusion

I love this machine: it looks beautiful, it is in great condition, and it works. In addition, it is fairly rare, especially in this condition. I don't have truly rare machines, but this one comes close, as does my aluminum Blickensderfer No. 5. I'd say that this machine is probably the crown jewel of my collection at this point.

Oh, and my young kids must be the only ones in the world to know that there is a "Fay-Sholes" typewriter ;)

xxx the badge on the paper table

The machine has a really nice dealer badge on the paper table, which I haven't touched. It says:

    Oscar Rutishauser & Co.
    Bureau-Artikel
    Oceanic St. Gallen

The dealer was in St. Gallen, a town in Switzerland.
