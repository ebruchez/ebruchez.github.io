## Introduction

In late 2019, I acquired this Remington Vertical Adder Model-121. If you know old typewriters a little, you might see a resemblance with a [Remington 12](../_posts/2018-12-09-remington-12-1924.md), but with extra stuff all over. This is in fact an *accounting machine*.

![One of the first pictures I took of the machine](/assets/posts/restoring-remington121/2x/IMG_9915.jpg){:standalone}

While few people are interested in this kind of machines,[^compared] I for one was pretty excited about it! First, I had some recent knowledge about how these work, since I had acquired a Remington Bookkeeping Machine Model-23 a few months before.

![The monster Model-23](/assets/posts/restoring-remington121/2x/IMG_9422.jpg){:standalone width="75%"}

The Model-121 seemed less intimidating, partly because it was a little cheaper, a little more recent,[^recent] and also because it didn't look as nice (or classic) overall. So I figured I would risk less by starting to work on this one as opposed to the Model-23.

We can debate on the differences between cleaning and restoring, but in this case there are parts that did need actual restoring. Specifically, the 9 tabulator keys, the 2 "Shift" keys, the "Shift Lock", and the "Back Spacer" keys.[^keylegends] This is because instead of regular glass or plastic key tops, those were made of a rubbery material which was disintegrating. More on this later.

## Dating

The Model-21 and Model-23 were clearly available in the 1920s, and this one has enhancements over Model-21 and a look typical of the 1930s. So I posit that the machine is probably from the 1930s. This said, I don't have certainty on this. Let me know if you know more! Newspaper or magazine ads could help narrow it down.

## Opening up the machine

Once you remove the side, front, and back panels, and remove the board onto which the machine is attached, you essentially get a [Remington 12](https://blog.bruchez.name/search/label/typewriters), except you don't have the 5-key tabulator (with "column selectors"), but the 9-key decimal tabulator which sits in front of the machine. In fact, the equivalent models would be the Remington 20 or 30, which have a decimal tabulator. The frame in the areas that are not intended to be visible only has basic, non-glossy paint, which makes sense. The top plate of the machine, as well as the front of the frame, are glossy black like on regular Remington machines.

![The "naked core"](/assets/posts/restoring-remington121/2x/IMG_0831.jpg){:standalone}

I removed the wooden base, which was held in place (or rather held the machine in place) with hooks. I dusted it, wiped it with warm water, and put some English Oil on it to see how it would look like, but I was not satisfied with this quick cleaning. I also removed some of the crumbled rubber from the feet in the holes. I will have to [xxx] glue back a part of the base which got separated from the rest. You can see the marks, on the right, where the tabulator keys have hit the wood. This tells us that the machine was certainly used and with this base!

![The wooden base after a quick but unsatisfying cleaning](/assets/posts/restoring-remington121/2x/IMG_0879.jpg){:standalone}

## Removing the Wahl mechanism

The front of the machine features the *Wahl mechanism* (or "Wahl attachment"), connected by linkages to the number keys. Unlike a regular Remington, all the number keys are present, including the "0" and the "1". This is because those keys actuate the Wahl mechanism: you wouldn't want to hook up the "i" or "o" keys which are in completely different locations and would also actuate the mechanism when using them as letters.

It's easy to remove and disconnect that part from the machine. I first removed the rack that holds the *totalizers*, the front panel, then disconnected the number keys linkages. A few screws later and the whole thing comes off.

![The dirty Wahl mechanism](/assets/posts/restoring-remington121/2x/IMG_0809.jpg){:standalone}

The mechanism was filthy. I degreased it for a short time in a bath of Simple Green, brushing a little as well. The water became black.

![The Simple Green bath](/assets/posts/restoring-remington121/2x/IMG_0818.jpg){:standalone}

Then I dried it with the air compressor, then with a hair dryer, and sparingly used PB Blaster on it - all of this to prevent rust after the Simple Green bath. The result is a much cleaner mechanism where everything moves nicely.

![Clean Wahl mechanism (front)](/assets/posts/restoring-remington121/2x/IMG_0821.jpg){:standalone}

![Clean Wahl mechanism (back)](/assets/posts/restoring-remington121/2x/IMG_0828.jpg){:standalone}

I will need a separate article to dig deeper into how the mechanism works.

## Basic cleaning

I cleaned the machine as I would usually, with compressed air, PB Blaster, mineral spirits, q-tips, wipes, etc. It's time-consuming but not difficult. The machine was quite dirty and dusty inside.

![Dirt](/assets/posts/restoring-remington121/2x/IMG_0759.jpg){:standalone}

After the basic cleaning, I was able to produce a typeface sample. Note all the units! Often, adding/bookkeeping machines don't even have a shift key. This one does, and it allows you to type all those units including "kegs" and "bottles"! But you can still only type in uppercase with this machine. I like the sans serif typeface.

![Typeface sample](/assets/posts/restoring-remington121/2x/IMG_0895.jpg){:standalone}

## More disassembly

I removed the comb which guides the key levers behind the keyboard, so I could clean it properly.

![The comb](/assets/posts/restoring-remington121/2x/IMG_1660.jpg){:standalone}

While doing so, a small strip of leather fell off. It was a little bit of a challenge to put it back, but it worked. That strip dampens the "Back Spacer" key when it comes back up. It is held in place with a small nut which is hard to tighten, from below the machine. I almost gave up putting it back! But I succeeded. I found out later that it is also present on the regular Remington 12.

![The leather strip](/assets/posts/restoring-remington121/2x/IMG_1665.jpg){:standalone}

## The tabulator

The tabulator is, conceptually at least, a descendant of the Gorin tabulator first introduced on Remington machines in 1896: you have here 9 keys in the front, connected with linkages that reach the back of the machine from below. Then a column in the back of the machine links those further to the top rear of the machine where they do the work of stopping the carriage's travel.

![The tabulator linkages](/assets/posts/restoring-remington121/2x/IMG_0833.jpg){:standalone width="75%"}

Compared with older Remington tabulators, which used push keys, here the mechanism has evolved to feature more regular keys which you press down, making them swivel. In the end, this still produces a movement that pushes linkages towards the back of the machine.

## Restoring the keys

I figured I had two major choices to restore the key tops with their disintegrating rubber (leaving them as is was out of the question, as the keys were ugly and unstable):

- Attempt to reproduce rubber or rubber-like key tops.
- Do something else.

I consider Sugru to make rubber key tops. However, that would become expensive as there are 13 keys to do and quite a bit of material needed. Then I'd need to make a mold to shape the key tops first. That would be possible with enough time, maybe even 3D-printing the mold.

I rejected this idea for now and I decided to make something different: glass keys, while keeping the idea of having different colors for the keys (green and red, like in the original).

I started by scraping off the rubber. That's the easy part.

![Removing the rubber](/assets/posts/restoring-remington121/2x/IMG_0886.jpg){:standalone}

I had used [Ponoko](https://www.ponoko.com/) already once in the past to make acrylic key tops for my Royal 5. I decided to do the same.

But in order to do this, I had to remove key rings. I tried a few ways, asked for advice online (Facebook group). What worked was putting the tab keys in a vise, and then using a flat screwdriver from below to pop them out.

![Removing rings](/assets/posts/restoring-remington121/2x/IMG_0887.jpg){:standalone}

They came out without damage except for a tiny scratch to the black paint that coated them. Some rings had dents already.

![Removing rings](/assets/posts/restoring-remington121/2x/IMG_0888.jpg){:standalone}

Interestingly, those keys had black paint, while the other keys on the keyboard are just nickeled.

I used Citri-Strip to remove the paint, as I planned to repaint them. But after removing that, I noticed the nickel (probably) underneath is actually pretty nice, and in order to pain them properly I'd have to sand them a little, which would make it harder to undo in the future if desired. So I opted to leave the 9 tabulator key rings as is for now.

![Citri-Strip](/assets/posts/restoring-remington121/2x/IMG_1710.jpg){:standalone}

After cleaning the keys and the front rack, I reassembled the keys with their new colored paper backs. Each key is a sandwich of multiple parts:

- cardboard to give additional thickness within the keys
- colored paper
- acrylic rounds
- key rings

![Each key is a sandwich](/assets/posts/restoring-remington121/2x/IMG_1752.jpg){:standalone}

They look pretty good!

![One of the green tab keys](/assets/posts/restoring-remington121/2x/IMG_1731.jpg){:standalone}

They are different from the original, while keeping the idea of color. And they are not entirely out of line as glass (here acrylic) keys were common all the way to the 1930s.

![Color!](/assets/posts/restoring-remington121/2x/IMG_1760.jpg){:standalone}

Interestingly enough, in March 2020, I saw a picture of another Model-121 (from a Breker auction) which appears to have glass tabulator keys. The shift and back spacer keys are not rubber either and look like the rest of the keyboard. It is possible that this was also a later replacement of damaged rubber keys, but who knows, they could also be original. We need more documents from the 1920s and 1930s to confirm this. That machine doesn't appear to have a base, and no totalizers. It has potential and it would be interesting to know who acquired it!

![Model-121 from the Tom Russo collection](/assets/posts/restoring-remington121/2x/model121tomrusso.jpg){:standalone}

## Restoring the other keys

Besides the tab keys, there were four other keys with the original rubber: the shift, shift lock, and back spacer keys.

I thought I would experiment with etching the acrylic, as that's something that Ponoko can do. Specifically, etching key legends. I know that the original machine probably did not have legends on those rubber key tops, but I thought that legends might look nice.

So my process started with taking pictures of Remington 12 keys.

![Some Remington 12 keytops](/assets/posts/restoring-remington121/2x/IMG_0925.jpg){:standalone width="75%"}

Then I cleaned the image with [Pixelmator](https://www.pixelmator.com/), and imported the images in [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/), the app I used to produce the final SVG file for Ponoko. I filled the body of the letters and had that etched, as well as the outline of the letters.

![Design for the key](/assets/posts/restoring-remington121/2x/)

The result looked pretty good for a first try I think! The etched acrylic comes with an adhesive protection.

![Etched keys from Ponoko](/assets/posts/restoring-remington121/2x/IMG_1073.jpg){:standalone}

From here I considered the following options:

- **Leaving the etching as is.** This means the legends are not very visible
- **Filling the etched areas with paint.** I tried this with enamel paint, and it was not easy to wipe the extra paint. Another type of paint might work better.
- **Filling the etched areas with a paint stick.** I used the Lacquer-Stick. This worked fairly well.
- **Print paper legends.**

So I went with the etched keys filled with Lacquer-Stick!

While I was doing this I  thought that I should have tried etching the legends reversed, so that the paint would appear *under* the acrylic rounds rather than at the surface. That might look good, actually, and protect the white paint from dirty fingers. But due to the price of Ponoko orders, I didn't try it. It's something to keep in mind for another machine.

For the color, I chose a "bleu royal". I figured it would make things more interesting. I am not sure how well this color goes with the tabulator keys, but that's what I went with. I decided not to repaint the back spacer key ring.

![The back spacer key](/assets/posts/restoring-remington121/2x/IMG_2555.jpg){:standalone}

I used the only two repainted rings for the shift keys. The smaller shift lock black key ring was in good enough condition that I left it alone.

![The restored keys](/assets/posts/restoring-remington121/2x/IMG_2556.jpg){:standalone}

Now I am not 100% happy. I think that maybe I should have chosen less "Christmasy" green/red colors, and the etched-and-filled legends might get dirty over time. Luckily, this can be updated/changed later if desired.

In addition, one tab key is skewed. I didn't dare force it back into shape, but again this is something to do later, maybe.

## The motor

Here the "motor" consists of a spring box. I wanted to remove the drawband, which was really dirty, but I couldn't figure out how to remove it entirely without removing the spring box as well. That's easy, with two screws, so I did. There are three ball bearings in that spring box, including one for the wheel that guides the drawband.

![The motor](/assets/posts/restoring-remington121/2x/IMG_1773.jpg){:standalone}

The drawband itself looks sturdy, but it has some damage in the middle due to friction. However, it seems still strong enough.

![The drawband](/assets/posts/restoring-remington121/2x/IMG_1776.jpg){:standalone}

## The typebar rest

Of course I took out the typebar rest for cleaning. It has some kind of foamy part, with a fabric strip on top, which was not holding in place anymore. So I glued it back on one side.

![Gluing back the strip](/assets/posts/restoring-remington121/2x/IMG_1919.jpg){:standalone}

It's really easy to remove and put it back, but you can only do this once the Wahl mechanism is out.

![The typebar rest back in place](/assets/posts/restoring-remington121/2x/IMG_1928.jpg){:standalone}

## Putting back the Wahl mechanism

This is as easy to put back as it was to take out. Two screws only hold in in place, and you have 11 linkages to connect: 10 for the numbers, and one for the Add/Subtract toggle. It's where you really see the history of this mechanism as an add-on. It seems that things are moving as they should.

![The Wahl mechanism back in place](/assets/posts/restoring-remington121/2x/IMG_1947.jpg){:standalone}

## The totalizers

### Background

The totalizers (that's the official term) are the counters that sit on a rack in front of the machine. They consist of a number of numbered wheels representing digits, including typically 2-digit decimals (for cents). Each wheel can be rotated individually and, when doing so, add or subtract from the number displayed.

A single totalizer is associated with a column in a document, such as "credits" or "debits". Machines like the Model-23 also have cross-totalizers, which sit on a different rack, and can compute line totals.

My Model-121 came with 3 7-digit totalizers. Separately, I acquired on eBay 2 8-digit totalizers, which I plan to use for the Model-23 (which was missing those). They look very similar. Remington made totalizers with from 4 to 16 wheels, with or without space between dollars and cents.

On the Model-121, you configure addition and subtraction manually with a lever. The Model-23 supports configuring the totalizers to either add, subtract, or do nothing (I believe), with a tab present on the totalizer, which actuates a lever on the Wahl mechanism proper.

![One of the 3 original 7-digit totalizers](/assets/posts/restoring-remington121/2x/IMG_0789.jpg){:standalone}

### Cleaning the first "spare" totalizer

I decided to clean one of my "spare" totalizers. Again, I used Simple Green for maybe 10 minutes, and brushed. This went well, but it removed the red paint on the decimal wheel. I then used compressed air, hair dryer, and PB Blaster.

![Totalizer bath](/assets/posts/restoring-remington121/2x/IMG_0966.jpg){:standalone}

The result is a quite clean part.

![Clean 8-digit totalizer without its covers](/assets/posts/restoring-remington121/2x/IMG_0969.jpg){:standalone}

I decided to go one step further and to attempt disassembly. I know that somebody did it. But I stopped after a while, thinking that it might be asking for too much trouble at this point. Instead, I just removed the number wheels.

![All the wheels](/assets/posts/restoring-remington121/2x/IMG_1039.jpg){:standalone}

I repainted the decimal wheel: sanding, primer, and spray paint. Of course I protected the sides so that only the visible part is painted red.

![Repainted decimal wheel](/assets/posts/restoring-remington121/2x/IMG_1493.jpg){:standalone}

xxx putting back the wheels

Now I made a mistake when I removed the wheels: I didn't set them up to be set to "000000.00", and so the wheels are now in an unknown position. I have to put them back correctly so that they will properly propagate to the next wheel when going from 9 to 0 or (when subtracting) from 0 to 9.

### The original 3 totalizers

For the next 2 totalizers I didn't make this mistake, and they worked properly after putting things back.

xxx more totalizers cleaning

However, the third totalizer appears stuck. I used PB Blaster so far to no avail. I haven't yet figured out what causes it to be stuck.

Interestingly enough, the two totalizers for which I removed the number wheels have an interesting feature: some of the wheels appear to have a semi-broken tooth facing the number "7". At first I thought they were really broken, but it cannot be a coincidence that all those are in the same spot, and that no other tooth has this issue. The extra totalizers I got don't have this.

Luckily, this doesn't appear to cause issue with the rotation of the wheels or the carry mechanism.

![Problematic teeth!](/assets/posts/restoring-remington121/2x/IMG_2583.jpg){:standalone}

## Cleaning the totalizers rack

I figured that the totalizers rack could be disassembled for deeper cleaning. So I did just that!

![Rack parts](/assets/posts/restoring-remington121/2x/IMG_2574.jpg){:standalone}

I realized later that there is a reason for the elongated holes: they control the horizontal alignment of the totalizers. It’s important to put this back correctly. Of course the alignment was incorrect after I put the rack back, and I had to re-adjust the screws in order to make the totalizers work again.

## First try after cleaning

With the rack back in place and two cleaned totalizers, I gave them a try! I positioned the totalizer and tried all the number keys, checking that they properly rotate the wheels. I also tried the carry, including going from 99999.99 to 00000.00 and back.

![Working totalizer](/assets/posts/restoring-remington121/2x/IMG_2593.jpg){:standalone}

The red arrow index, which helps knowing where the insertion point is relative to the totalizer, is broken. I notice that it's made of some kind of plastic (maybe bakelite?), while on my Model-23 is is made of metal. I will have to find the part or to make one at some point.

## Fixing the backspacer

I noticed that the backspace key didn't work: it pushed the carriage back, but didn't stay in position and the carriage returned to its original position.

First, I imagined that maybe the carriage didn't go back far enough when pressing the key. But I ruled this out quickly.

Then I just observed the two Remington 12 machines I already have. I noticed that one of the gears turned when it shouldn't. I thought that maybe this was due to dirt causing it to rotate when it shouldn't. So I used penetrating oil to free that. But it didn't work, and thinking about it it shouldn't have worked, since depending on friction alone would have been bad design.

Finally I found that a spring was not pushing back a ratchet properly. Pushing it with my hand fixed the problem. Curiously, the mechanism is slightly different on the two Remington 12s I checked, but luckily one of the mechanisms was identical so I am confident that I fixed things properly and now the spring is back to working as intended.

## Gluing back the base board

The base board had a part that was detaching. I had to glue it back. I used Gorilla wood glue and clamped it overnight.

![Clamps](/assets/posts/restoring-remington121/2x/IMG_2742.jpg){:standalone}

I hope that this will be strong enough! There is a small wood piece which is missing under the board. It probably added some strength to the board, but at this point I don't know how to get or make a replacement, so I am leaving it as is for now. But I also glued a smaller piece on the other side which was broken.

![More clamps](/assets/posts/restoring-remington121/2x/IMG_2745.jpg){:standalone}

After that, I decided to restain the board. I used wood filler to fill in some spaces on the top, as well as the bottom. On the top, the filler was probably not necessary everywhere I put it, but whatever was not necessary got sanded down later.

![Letting the wood filler dry](/assets/posts/restoring-remington121/2x/IMG_2758.jpg){:standalone}

It's not a perfect job as the bottom was not in great condition. Then I sanded the board, using 80, 120, 150, 220, 320 and 400 sandpaper.

![Sanding](/assets/posts/restoring-remington121/2x/IMG_2759.jpg){:standalone}

![The board sanded up to 400 grit](/assets/posts/restoring-remington121/2x/IMG_2776.jpg){:standalone}

The following step was to apply Watco Danish oil. I watched a couple of videos and I tried it out on a small bit of wood, and then on the bottom of the board. Unfortunately, the oil I picked ("light walnut") came too dark to my taste. But it was only the bottom of the board, which, anyway, didn't look too good. Still, I gave the bottom a quick round of sanding, and I decided to switch to the natural oil instead.

![After a few coats of Danish oil](/assets/posts/restoring-remington121/2x/IMG_2925.jpg){:standalone}

I am still wondering whether I should have sanded the top more, as there are still some marks and black spots. But that's how it is right now. Once the last coat was dry (after a few days), I gave it a quick round of sanding with 600 grit as I felt it wasn't quite smooth anymore.

I also put some pads underneath in order to be able to put the board on other furniture without scratching it. I could have used rubber ones. These might slip, but the machine is so heavy that hopefully this won't be a problem. I positioned them to face the machine's feet on the other side of the board.

![Pads](/assets/posts/restoring-remington121/2x/IMG_2970.jpg){:standalone}

For now, I gave up on adding a polyurethane finish on top. The board is now clean enough and protected from the elements to some extent.

Overall, fairly little of the board is visible anyway. It's almost too bad. But I can tell that the board was made with this in mind: it's actually built out of several quite different pieces of wood.

## Cleaning and polishing the body panels

I had already cleaned one body panel earlier in the process, and now I had to do the other one.

Before any polish, make sure you clean the body well. I used Turtle Wax polishing compound. I think that my polishing skills (and/or materials and tools) are not there. The paint is shiny on pictures, but under the shop lights, I still see lots of marks and uneven areas. Something to figure out and improve at some point!

I ended up redoing both side panels, and even separating the back panels, which I cleaned with Simple Green and WD-40.

![The big side and back panels, cleaned](/assets/posts/restoring-remington121/2x/IMG_2977.jpg){:standalone}

I also polished the door knob and the ribbon knob with Mother's polish. These two knobs now look great!

![The door knob](/assets/posts/restoring-remington121/2x/IMG_2978.jpg){:standalone}

## Putting it all together

I had to put the machine back on the board. It's attached to the board with two hooks.

## Conclusion

Almost exactly 4 months after I started, the restoration is complete (although there is always something here or there to do).

![Final result](/assets/posts/restoring-remington121/2x/IMG_3006.jpg){:standalone}

In late 2020, I had a custom cover made for it, to protect it from dust.

Oh, and it got 2nd place at the Virtual Herman's beauty contest :)

[^compared]: Compared with portable typewriters, rare antique typewriters, or even more classic standard (desktop) machines.

[^recent]: There are several indications that Model-121 is newer than Model-23. First, there is the model number, of course! There was a Model-21 which was made at the same time as the Model-23. Model-121 appears to be a successor to the Model-21 vertical adders. There are other aspects, in particular the position of the number keys, the updated tab keys, and the newer-style body panels, including crinkle paint in the back, which indicate a newer machine.

[^keylegends]: Following the terminology of the Remington 12.
