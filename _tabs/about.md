My name is Erik Bruchez. I was born and raised in Switzerland, where I spent the first 25 years of my life. Since 1997 I have lived in the San Francisco Bay area (with a hiatus around 2005), now in [Foster City](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foster_City,_California). I am married with two kids. I work as a programmer (and *homme Ã  tout faire*) for a small company, [Orbeon](http://www.orbeon.com/), that I co-founded back in 1999 with my friend Alex. I love technology, music, and philosophy. I believe that we have to keep refining our thoughts and view of the world to make any progress in life.
