Have followed an unprecendented growth trajectory since its introduction, this run is the first in which Swift has not gained but merely held its position of #17. […] But it’s clear that further gains for Swift will not come easily, and will instead be the product of widespread usage across an array of communities. As discussed in the last iteration of these rankings, Swift has opened up new avenues for growth beyond iOS development via its release as open source software and the embrace of third parties like IBM or Perfect, but these have yet to yield gains in new discussion or code sufficient to propel it forward in these rankings. We’ll be watching for signs of this type of new growth closely.”<li>Ok, so I was definitely too aggressive again, and Objective-C still leads. I am sure Swift will overtake Objective-C within a few years, but I cannot guess where to put the line now. Another 2 years? 5 years?

So my prediction has obviously failed. But RedMonk says of Swift:<blockquote><p>“Even if you assign little importance to the actual ranking, then, there is no debate that Swift is growing faster than anything else we track. The forthcoming release of Swift as open source and availability of builds for Linux, as well, should theoretically provide even more momentum going forward.”</p></blockquote><li>One interesting aspect of the respective ranking of Objective-C/Swift is that the languages are linked and the rise of Swift will happen at the detriment of Objective-C. So as Swift becomes more popular, Objective-C will become less so.<li>I think the momentum of Swift 2 will be big, causing many iOS programmers to consider a switch to Swift.

I am pretty sure that self-driving cars will happen, although some legal, social, and technological obstacles remain. The big question is <em>when</em> they will be overcome, and what kind of predictions make sense.</p><p>Here are some examples of milestones that come to mind:</p><ul><li>Demonstration of end-to-end automated vehicles picking up and dropping off people in realistic scenarios (such as home to work). This must include the ability for the vehicle to park or wait in a safe location, and to drive safely and without unreasonable delays. This must include local driving, and may include highway driving. For demonstration purposes, a human supervisor may be present in the car.<li>First US state to allow (under conditions to be met) certain types of fully automated vehicles on at least some public roads. Such vehicles do not require a driver at all, and might not even have a driving wheel (like the Google car). No driver license is needed to enter the car. The car can circulate on its own without any human aboard.<li>First lawsuit related to to a self-driving vehicle having allegedly caused harm.<li>First company operating a fleet of fully automated taxis (it could be Uber).<li>Self-driving vehicles (owned or not) are an option for some people (in the same way electric vehicles such as the Nissan Leaf are as of 2015) as a replacement for a regular car. Such vehicles might be operated by a separate company. They are an option to take people to and from work on a daily basis, as well as perform other trips.<li>Self-driving vehicles are mainstream.<li>Rate of car ownership in the US is reduced by 50% compared to 2015 levels.<li>Number of cars on the road in the US is reduced by 50% compared to 2015 levels.<li>Merger/bankruptcy of large car manufacturers due to the reduced market for vehicles.<li>Cities start reclaiming and repurposing roads and unused parking lots.<li>Most (more than 50%) people don’t own a car.<li>It is reasonable to most young people (at least in a certain area) to completely avoid getting a driver license and never learn how to drive.<li>Some public roads are closed to vehicles with human drivers.</ul><p>Trucks are also an obvious target for self-driving technology as they drive long distances. Here are a few milestones:</p><ul><li>Demonstration of self-driving 18-wheeler for long highway drives (such as CA highway 5). Daimler has just revealed a <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/07/self-driving-truck_n_7225490.html">limited concept in May 2015</a>.
