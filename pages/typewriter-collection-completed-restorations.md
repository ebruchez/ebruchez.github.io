# Typewriter Collection: Completed Restorations

## Introduction

How should we use the word "restoration" when applied to typewriters? Like with many words, there can be a more or less strict meaning. The word generally means "bring back to a previous, functional, or original state." Under this general definition, work done on a typewriter is a restoration if it gets it closer to its former glory. A stricter definition could require that parts be fixed or replaced, or significant work such as disassembly or paint touch-ups be performed. On this page, I start with projects that qualify for the stricter use of the word under "Advanced restorations," and I continue with projects that involved significant work â€” just not as much.

## Advanced restorations

    <figcaption>1902 - This Remington 6 was almost entirely disassembled for restoration. Some parts were replated. The typebar rest got redone. It has a new ribbon, a new paper table, and a new platen. Otherwise, it is a fairly conservative restoration.

    <figcaption>1911 - This Oliver 5 needed a lot of work but it was worth it. It was largely disassembled. I replaced its escapement wheel, replaced the main spring, added new rubber feet, and fixed and completely refinished the wooden base. This machine alo has a new platen, and got a new Oliver pencil in its holder.

    <figcaption>1910s - This uncommon Yost No. 20 was not in bad condition and mostly needed cleaning. But its front decal looked poor. I reapplied shellac over the entire front panel to make it look shiny again. Its wooden base still needs work.

    <figcaption>1930s - This Remington Model-121 is one of my favorite completed projects. The machine needed significant work (at my level of skill), but turned out beautiful. I refinished the wooden base, recreated the colored key legends, which had disintegrated. The machine's paint turned out beautiful once polished.

    <figcaption>1950s - This VariTyper model 610 F was entirely frozen when I got it. I disassembled it, unfroze it, performed some adjustments, replaced the power cable, added some missing screws, and completed its collection of fonts. This is one of my treasured machines.

    <figcaption>1956 - This Royal Quiet de Luxe in Teal (or Turquoise?) was in poor condition when I got it. But it got derusted, provided with some new replacement keytops. Its broken platen know was epoxied back. This machine has a new platen.

    <figcaption>1967 - This IBM Model D Executive with Mid-Century typeface required more work than expected. It originally had some water damage on the right side. The machine was thoroughly cleaned. The body panels were swapped with a regular Model D's. The paper guides were obtained from a parts machine. A broken carriage lever was replaced, which required significant disassembly of the carriage.

## Other restorations

<div class="tw-table">

<figure>
    <img src="/assets/pages/typewriter-completed-restorations/IMG_9847.jpg"/>
    <figcaption>1900s - This Fay-Sholes No. 7 didn't need much besides cleaning and polishing, but I am very happy with it. It's one of my rarest machines.</figcaption>
</figure>
<figure>
    <img src="/assets/pages/typewriter-completed-restorations/IMG_3313.jpg"/>
    <figcaption>1909 - This aluminum Blickensderfer 5 is one of my luckiest finds. This is a semi-completed project. The machine should still be fully disassembled for cleaning. It already has a new platen.</figcaption>
</figure>
<figure>
    <img src="/assets/pages/typewriter-completed-restorations/IMG_6670.jpg"/>
    <figcaption>1910s - This uncommon Victor 3 was in good condition. I repainted the color indicator on the right. I decided to leave its gray platen as is.</figcaption>
</figure>
<figure>
    <img src="/assets/pages/typewriter-completed-restorations/IMG_3095.jpg"/>
    <figcaption>1913 - This Corona 3 is a fairly early instance. Notice that it doesn't have a segment, which was added to later versions of this model, but instead it features ball-bearing typebars. The segment came later, supposedly in 1915, but it appears that lower serial numbers from 1913 had a segment. This instance had a broken ribbon wheel, and an issue with the carriage, which I repaired. The platen was falling apart and got replaced. Some cleaning and polishing made this machine shine really nicely! While the frontmost decal has scratches, this is not unusual, and on the other hand the paper table and main decals are in perfect condition.</figcaption>
</figure>
<figure>
    <img src="/assets/pages/typewriter-completed-restorations/IMG_3330.jpg"/>
    <figcaption>1942 - This humble Underwood "S" was bought for cheap. It smelled terrible. But after solid cleaning, polishing, and a new platen, it is one of my favorite machines.</figcaption>
</figure>
<figure>
    <img src="/assets/pages/typewriter-completed-restorations/IMG_4249.jpg"/>
    <figcaption>1946 - Believe it or not, but this Hermes Media 2000 didn't look like much originally. But after cleaning and polishing, it looks stunning. It has a new platen.</figcaption>
</figure>
<figure>
    <img src="/assets/pages/typewriter-completed-restorations/IMG_8458.jpg"/>
    <figcaption>1949 - This Underwood Rhythm Touch had a broken escapement wheel. I swapped the escapement wheel from a parts machine. I replaced the sound-proofing material inside, polished, and cleaned everything. I really like the bicolor keyboard, and the metal stripes around the machine make it very classy.</figcaption>
</figure>
<figure>
    <img src="/assets/pages/typewriter-hermes/IMG_3853.jpg"/>
    <figcaption>1949 - This Hermes Baby with Swiss-German QWERTZ keyboard has been refurbished and is one of my best-looking portables, in part thanks to the new red felt.</figcaption>
</figure>
<figure>
    <img src="/assets/pages/typewriter-hermes/IMG_3786.jpg"/>
    <figcaption>1951 - This is the younger sibling of the 1949 Hermes Baby with Swiss-German QWERTZ keyboard. This machine has also been refurbished with red felt.</figcaption>
</figure>
<figure>
    <img src="/assets/pages/typewriter-completed-restorations/IMG_7207.jpg"/>
    <figcaption>1951 - This early Hermes Ambassador has a new platen, new button, and a new back panel, which was missing when I got the machine.</figcaption>
</figure>
<figure>
    <img src="/assets/pages/typewriter-completed-restorations/IMG_4185.jpg"/>
    <figcaption>1951 - This IBM Model A Executive got thoroughly cleaned. I replaced a broken button in the front with a part machine's. It has a new platen. The key legends were refilled with a paint stick. It has new sound-proofing material.</figcaption>
</figure>
<figure>
    <img src="/assets/pages/typewriter-hermes/IMG_7502.jpg"/>
    <figcaption>1971 - This white plastic Hermes Baby with Swiss-German QWERTZ keyboard is not as sturdy as the earlier metal-bodied ones, but I think that it still looks beautiful after refurbishing. Like with my earlier Babys, I used the red felt treatment.</figcaption>
