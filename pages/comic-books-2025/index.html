Schulz<li>NOTES:<ul><li>a lot of Red Baron episodes<li>Peppermint Patty appears in 1966; she tries to save Charlie Brown’s baseball team, but then considers it impossible and gives up; she considers Snoopy the best player</ul></ul><li>2025-08-01: <a href="https://www.bedetheque.com/BD-Blake-et-Mortimer-Les-Aventures-de-HS3-Le-Dernier-Pharaon-367398.html">Autour de Blake &amp; Mortimer - Le dernier pharaon</a><ul><li>2019<li>tags: #reread<li>Language: French<li>Scénario: Jaco Van Dormael, Thomas Gunzig, Laurent Durieux<li>Dessin: François Schuitten<li>NOTES:<ul><li>First reread of this 2019 story.<li>This is a very long story (around 170 pages in the large, horizontal format that I have, but 85 pages in the regular format), with incredibly beautiful art by Shuitten.<li>The art is particularly showcased in the large format, and the colors by Laurent Durieux appear beautiful here.<li>It is, of course, only lightly related to the Blake &amp; Mortimer universe. This ties in to the Mystère de la Grande Pyramide, but in spirit, it is more of a Shuitten and Peeter Cités Obscures story.<li>The premise is fantastic, if not phantasmagoric: a sort of secret society, initiated by the ancient Egyptians, who built a system of pyramids, including an inverted one below the ground of the Brussels Palace of Justice, which are necessary for a technological civilization. This massive system can be turned off by a mechanism at the top of the palace, only by the “Last Pharaoh” who turns out to be Pr. Mortimer. He does manage to do so, eventually, and the world is saved but also loses advanced technology.<li>As found in a review, the scenario contains “d’ésotérisme, de politique, de terrorisme, d’environnement, de science-fiction, de fantastique, de monstres préhistoriques, de thérapies « nouvelâgeuses » et de complots millénaristes, sans oublier les nombreuses séquences oniriques qui ponctuent l’ensemble”. So yes, it is a little confused.<li>I do not agree with the implied premise that technology is inherently bad, and that it would be a good thing to turn it off. Neither would Mortimer, I think.<li>It is also a little weird that Blake and Mortimer, while they work together for the same purpose, are presented as having drifted apart over time. Why would these two heroes fall, or become unappreciated by the world at large?<li>I wish the scenario was a little better, but it fits ok in the Shuitten and Peeters universe. The art being amazing makes up for it in great part.</ul></ul><li>2025-07-30: <a href="https://www.amazon.it/-/en/dp/B09J1X5BB9">Mickey e la Terra degli Antichi</a><ul><li>2022<li>Language: Italian<li>Sceneggiatura: Denis-Pierre Filippi<li>Disegni: Silvio Camboni<li>NOTES:<ul><li>This is a beautifully made Mickey story. The art, in particular, is excellent.<li>The authors revive classic characters from the Floyd Gottfredson era, including Phantom Blot, Pete, and the three monkeys Ecks, Doublex, and Triplex, who are all the main villains of the story.<li>Minnie is shown as driven and courageous, and she is not just a damsel in distress.<li>This universe has potential, and I am hoping for a follow-up story.<li>When I bought the Italian edition, I thought that it was the original one. But the original appears to be the French edition, which, it seems, has better printing quality.</ul></ul><li>2025-07-23: <a href="https://shop.sergiobonelli.it/dragonero/2024/03/13/libro/dragonero-zagor-il-viaggio-degli-eroi-1024395/">Dragonero - Il viaggio degli eroi</a><ul><li>2024<li>Language: Italian<li>Sceneggiatura: Luca Enoch<li>Disegni: Gregorini Gianluigi<li>NOTES:<ul><li>This is the second story with the character of Zagor, after “Avventura a Darkwood”, and again involves universes crossing. This time, it is Zagor and Cico who go to Dragonero’s universe.<li>The premise is that these universes are truly going to collide and that a great catastrophe will happen if the heroes don’t fix it.<li>The trope of the “Amazons” is there again.<li>I still know little about the character of Zagor, being only familiar with it thanks to these two crossover stories.<li>Zagor was created by Sergio Bonelli in 1961. The book and the other Dragonero books in this series are published by the publishing company bearing his name.</ul></ul><li>2023-04-04: <a href="https://shop.sergiobonelli.it/dragonero/2023/09/08/libro/dragonero-la-regina-degli-algenti-1023565/">Dragonero - La regina degli Algenti</a><ul><li>2023<li>Language: Italian<li>Sceneggiatura: Luca Enoch<li>Disegni: Gregorini Gianluigi<li>NOTES:<ul><li>I am not a huge fan of things like sand worms and blood, and there is a lot of that in this story.<li>I like the Farghs, sorts of gigantic mammoth-like creatures.<li>The whole story is colored largely gray and red, which gives it an unusual feel.<li>The “Algenti”, scary mostly brainless creatures, remind me of the “White Walkers” from Game of Thrones. Of course, the whole idea of having weird, dangerous stuff beyond a wall is similar to Game of Thrones.<li>The character of Ecuba, who turns out to be the queen of the Algenti, is fairly one-dimensional, and is reduced to absolute hatred for those she thinks have abandoned her, even though they haven’t. She is irrational, but that’s a trait of many villains. She has lost her humanity and does not wish to recover it.<li>It’s not my favorite of the hardcover Dragonero stories, but it is ok.</ul></ul><li>2025-07-20: <a href="https://www.bedetheque.com/BD-XIII-Mystery-Tome-1-La-Mangouste-78525.html">XIII Mystery - 1.

Hergé’s real-life friend, Tchang Tchong-jen, helped him with the Chinese culture and Chinese characters in the book, thereby giving the China of the 1930s a more authentic feel, mostly free of the prejudices common in the West at the time.<li>Tintin is here a young hero, of course, but also very sensitive to the plight of the oppressed.<li>Tintin’s new friendship with Tchang is very touching.<li>The Dupondt are, as is fit, made fun of. They want to be Tintin’s friend, but still follow their orders, even though they regret it in the end.<li>The story is full of action: abductions, poisonings, madness, conspiracies, corruption. But also kindness, loyalty, friendship, and just plain unbelievable luck.<li>But we also see a rich but dark political background, which matches the times, but have clear echoes in the 2020s.</ul></ul><li>2025-07: <a href="https://www.bedetheque.com/BD-Lucky-Luke-Tome-9-Des-rails-sur-la-prairie-245.html">Lucky Luke - 9.

There is Caesar, going to Britain as he was promised riches by Viridoros, the vilain of the story who ends up being a traitor. There is Mancios, a prince of Britain, who helps Caesar, hoping to retake his position held by an usurper, Cassinos. The druids, including a female druid, are also involved. Caesar and his troupes narrowly escape following the treason of Viridoros. It turns out that there wouldn’t be many riches to obtain anyway and Ceasar leaves Britain, with a promise of never coming back. Alix and Enak play their usual hero roles, siding as well as they can with the good guys, and expressing skepticism towards Caesar’s adventure.</ul></ul><li>2025-03: <a href="">Luc Orient - Le mur</a><ul><li>1994<li>tags: #reread<li>Scenario: Greg<li>Dessin: Eddy Paape<li>NOTES:<ul><li>11 pages, with 6 completed and 5 of Greg’s scenario only.

Clearly there was a spirit of “progress” at the time.<li>Thinking about that, the technical decors were not Paape’s forte. Compare this with masters at such decors, like Roger Leloup. Paape, instead, is very minimalistic.</ul></ul><li>2025-03: <a href="https://www.bedetheque.com/BD-Luc-Orient-Tome-11-La-vallee-des-eaux-troubles-24363.html">Luc Orient - 11. La vallée des eaux troubles</a><ul><li>1976<li>tags: #reread<li>Scenario: Greg<li>Dessin: Eddy Paape<li>NOTES:<ul><li>Overall a pretty good story, although not my favorite topic.<li>Kala and Lora are almost entirely absent.<li>Orient’s last comment has a weird religious implication, unexpected from a scientist: “Yes, I wonder if someone else has not, more than Wolfgang Rafael, forbidden that the mystery of this ‘pirate’ creation should be repeated.” But I suppose that this is present for effect. It reminds me of the “Junior Mint” episode of Seinfeld, where the doctor says “I have no medical evidence to back me up but something happened during the operation that staved off that infection. Something beyond science. Something perhaps… from above.”.<li>I like that the natives of the jungle are well depicted, and always respected by Orient and his teammates.</ul></ul><li>2025-02: <a href="https://www.bedetheque.com/BD-Luc-Orient-Tome-10-Le-6eme-continent-24362.html">Luc Orient - 10. Le 6ème continent</a><ul><li>1976<li>tags: #reread<li>Scenario: Greg<li>Dessin: Eddy Paape<li>NOTES:<ul><li>I had taken notes earlier about the weird depiction of skiing, and that remains a little funny. This said, Kala and Toba are supposed to be decent skiers, and they are shown with a good, advanced posture, especially for the time (1970s). Orient is supposed to be a poor skier, and mostly sticks to that, but there are a couple of exceptions where he is shown with a posture too good for his level, especially considered that this is off-piste skiing. Still, all skiers go downhill all the time, and that is not how skiing on that kind of terrain works. Toba even says “Only another half hour of effort”, shown in a cross-country skiing posture, which might indicate they are not skiing downhill at that point, but that contradicts the previous frame where Orient is struggling to go downhill. I suspect that Paape was not a skier.<li>I like the depiction of the ski resort, which seems inspired by Zermatt.<li>The “human anthill” idea is not bad, although you would think that getting all that is needed for such a society would make it difficult to keep it secret over 1500 years. I still find the final destruction of the underground city a bit odd.</ul></ul><li>2025-02: <a href="https://www.bedetheque.com/BD-Luc-Orient-Tome-9-24-heures-pour-la-planete-terre-24361.html">Luc Orient - 9. 24 heures pour la planète terre</a><ul><li>1975<li>tags: #reread<li>Scenario: Greg<li>Dessin: Eddy Paape<li>NOTES:<ul><li>The world is at the mercy of a single extraterrestrial (Okjorr, from Trementhawah, who doesn’t reveal his nature to Earth) able to destroy materials and life on Earth. He first shows off his power of destruction on a bridge, to convince world leaders to convene, which they do, but for what purpose we don’t really know. World leaders decide not to negotiate with the “destroyer”, whatever he wants. Orient is contacted by another ET, Rojkorr, who wants to counter Okjorr. He reveals to Orient the original plan of his species: submit Earth, and convert all forms of life by removing their blood, but in exchange making them “better”. Okjorr seems more aggressive, and on a path to, instead, submit or even eliminate all life on Earth. So Rojkorr decides to betray his species, and help Orient. In a second show of power, Okjorr destroys the Statue of Liberty, but the damage is contained thanks to blood plasma. This is the parade, which stops Okjorr in his plans. Rojkorr sets up an encounter between Orient and Okjorr. The latter says he has decided to burn the Earth’s atmosphere instead, in a last vindictive act. Orient and Rojkorr manage to stop and destroy him. Rojkorr becomes human, although without blood.<li>The story is fine on its face, but the focus on blood seems a bit odd.<li>The motivations of Okjorr are unclear. They are supposed to be a smarter race, but he shows all the worst traits of humans. Also, although they can live 10,000 years, he doesn’t seem bothered by committing suicide in the end.<li>Okjorr regains his original appearance in death. Orient seems disgusted by his monstrous aspect, but he is not that different from humans. However, I like that Paape doesn’t fully show the appearance of the Trementhawans, but instead shows hints of that appearance.<li>Overall, this is not my favorite Luc Orient story.</ul></ul><li>2025-02: <a href="https://www.bedetheque.com/BD-Luc-Orient-Tome-8-La-legion-des-anges-maudits-40220.html">Luc Orient - 8.

But her helpers didn’t ask her whether she was armed or not before going through.<li>Granya is told not to look at the gaze from the landing ship, or she “would be killed instantly”. But the rest of the body is ok?<li>As usual, the SF aspects are a little wonky. We are told that dynamite will behave differently on Terango. We know that the atmosphere of Terango is different, but are the laws of physics? Surely, with Sectan having an invasion fleet, the Terganguians know about explosive.<li>The Thargs are somehow made immune to radioactivity, and then clad in radioactive material, making them human bombs. But of course, it’s not at all how nuclear bombs work. Then somehow it all goes away.<li>In short, the science doesn’t hold well, and you just have to suspend disbelief.</ul></ul><li>2025-02: <a href="https://www.bedetheque.com/BD-Luc-Orient-Tome-4-La-planete-de-l-angoisse-24357.html">Luc Orient - 4.
