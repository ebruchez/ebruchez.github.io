- 2024-08-15: [Donjon Zénith - 8. En sa mémoire](https://www.bedetheque.com/BD-Donjon-Zenith-Tome-8-En-sa-memoire-405140.html)
    - 2020

    - Scénario: Lewis Trondheim
    - Dessin: Boulet
    - NOTES: I had almost entirely forgotten that I had read this 3 years ago. Herbert is on his way to announce to Marvin's mother that Marvin is getting married with Pirzuine. There, he meets Gilberto in training. They both learn that Marvin's mother was killed. They are suspected and condemned to death, but find a way to temporarily at least escape the sentence. Gilberto discovers weed. Herbert is chosen to investigate the death. Marvin arrives, his mother's death is first hidden but Gilberto reveals it. They unmask the shaman Mardukian as the killer. He escapes, they chase him, avoid his tricks, and he is defeated. The other dragons still protect him, but Marvin, off-screen, kills Mardukian. Gilberto continues his training, but this time uses weed.

    - Scénario: Yann
    - Dessin: Roman Surzhenko
    - Rating: 3/5
    - NOTES: The story continues. Thorgal, Aaricia, Sveyn, and others flee from Harald. Sveyn learns that his adoptive father is dead. They reach an island, but the water is poisoned. They find underground a group of women who decided to leave outside of society to escape the cruelty of men. Among them is Sveyn's mother. Harald finds them, horribly tortures Thorbiorg (there is a disturbing panel), but eventually is killed by Sveyn, who becomes the new leader. Although he is not cruel like Harald, he promises his men conquests.

    - 2006
    - Language: French
    - Scénario: Alexandre Astier
    - Dessin: Steven Dupré
    - Rating: 3/5
    - NOTES: You have to know Kaamelott the TV series to appreciate this. I definitely imagine the actors' voices while reading. I find that the character's faces look similar, and are recognizable, but a little too different from those of the TV series. At times, the faces are too distorted for my taste. The story itself is ok. I am in general not a fan of stories about zombies. I am not sure that I will continue this series yet, but I was curious enough to get the first album.

- 2024-08-06: [Ralph Azham - 12. Lâcher prise](https://www.bedetheque.com/BD-Ralph-Azham-Tome-12-Lacher-prise-371392.html)
    - 2019
    - Language: French
    - Scénario et dessin: Lewis Trondheim
    - NOTES: The end of the saga. Ralph's new castle is almost done. Clothilde says she plans to leave soon. Ralphs's team still tries to bring justice to assassins. The king comes back and appears intent on taking power again. Tilda comes back, and is now in a relationship with Ralph. However, the king (who is 1,000-year-old, remember) decides to stage a coup to take power again by killing everyone on his path. A new character comes into play: Xenophon. He is, well, 5,000-year-old. He wants to ally with Ralph to kill the king, and then handle the situation of the "blued". For that, Ralph and Tilda are aged temporarily so they can escape. The king finds them, and the final battle takes place: several of Ralph's friends are killed, but eventually the king is defeated through a combination of power that I don't quite understand. Xenophon tells Ralph that he wants to blow up the moon Moogthar, so that there will no longer be new "blued" with special powers. Ralph gives his power to Tilda, who is "born to rule", and then uses the "stone of forgetfulness" to leave or disappear. Several reviewers think that the second part of the saga is not as good as the first part, and that too many things are left open, including the fate of several of the characters. The entire idea of the "blued", and why they exist in this universe, is not explained. Some reviewers, while not ecstatic about the second part of the saga, think that it's still a pretty good ending, and that it makes sense: the king is gone, but Ralph never liked power and has lost friends, so he prefers to leave and forget. Still, he appears disilliusioned about human nature, witness the failure of installing democracy in that town.
- 2024-08-05: [Ralph Azham - 11. L'engrenage](https://www.bedetheque.com/BD-Ralph-Azham-Tome-11-L-engrenage-326815.html)
    - 2018
    - Language: French
    - Scénario et dessin: Lewis Trondheim
    - NOTES: Ralph and friends go meet Tilda Pönns, who eventually becomes an ally. The big threat is the "religion of the 4 gods", which was made up by the king in the old times, but which is now very powerful on its own and wants to eliminate Ralph and take all the power. In the meanwhile, Ralph go explore a small village where people have lost their memory, and is not welcome by its inhabitants, who, in fact, try to kill him by burying him alive in an old underground city. Piatch (I don't remember who he is!) goes to check whether democracy took root in the town where Ralph set it up, but finds Zania in prison about to be executed, and that in fact the elected burgmeister got corrupted and things don't work as planned. She is saved by Piatch but escapes. Tilda and Ralph meet with the high priests and a lot of their top people, and Tilda obliterates them (à la "Game of Thrones", as a commentator suggested). Ralph's father is poisoned by a gift that was sent to Ralph, and, about to day, asks Ralph to kill him so he can stay as a ghost to help him. But Ralph is seen by Rose. She leaves, and so does Yassou, the kid-who-aged, and who was into the religion.

- 2024-08-02: [Sillage - 23. Immersion](https://www.bedetheque.com/BD-Sillage-Tome-23-Immersion-488781.html)
    - Scénario: Philippe Buchet
    - Dessin et couleur: Philippe Buchet
    - Rating: 4/5
    - NOTES: I liked this story, where [spoiler] the métamorphes finally get their due. Juliette, the computer genius, is abducted to help the enemy. I like the appearance of the "Grand Mégagister" or "Haut-Magister" Hattoyro IV. I could have done with less of Nävis's fight scenes on the ship. 
- 2024-07-31: [Sillage - 22. Transfert](https://www.bedetheque.com/BD-Sillage-Tome-22-Transfert-462503.html)
    - Scénario: Philippe Buchet
    - Dessin et couleur: Philippe Buchet
    - Rating: 4/5
    - NOTES: The idea of two sister planets rotating around two suns, with a transfer of populations, animals and plants between the two planets every 5 years, is interesting. Overall I enjoyed this story.
- 2024-07-30: [Sillage - 21. Exfiltration](https://www.bedetheque.com/BD-Sillage-Tome-21-Exfiltration-437531.html)
    - Scénario: Jean David Morvan, Philippe Buchet
    - Dessin et couleur: Philippe Buchet
    - tags: #reread
    - Rating: TODO 
    - NOTES: Ratings for this story on Bédéthèque are not great. Reviewers think that the story is too tightly connected to recent (2021?) events, probably migrants in the Mediterranean. The story is too much of a feel-good story. However, I think that there is a lot of good stuff in there, in spite of a few too many "There are women and children here". My main criticism would be that Nävis's approach wouldn't scale. But then, of course she plans to take down those how are organizing the exploitation of those populations in subsequent albums.
- [Olivier Rameau - INT2. Intégrale 2](https://www.bedetheque.com/BD-Olivier-Rameau-INT2-Integrale-2-123409.html)
    - 2024-07: [Olivier Rameau 6.L'oiseau de Par-ci, par-là](https://www.bedetheque.com/BD-Olivier-Rameau-Tome-6-L-oiseau-de-Par-ci-par-la-26348.html)
        - 1975
        - tags: #reread
        - NOTES: Trip from the real world to Rêverose, thanks to a flight that got lost in a storm. The big bad businessman is a less appealing version of some other characters seen in Achille Talon, such as the businessman in "Le grain de la folie" who ends up being a good guy, and probably others. The two bad guys are pretty bad: the one with the weapon shoots with real (in the story) bullets at the bell, which luckily just got tickled. But then he shoots a human, luckily having ran out of ammunition in his magazine. The flight is a little funny, being almost empty, and first class not quite looking like first class. But then, this was the 1970s, and people's experience with flying was not what it is today. Getting people drunk with Champagne is a little weird.
    - 2024-07: [Olivier Rameau 5. Le grand voyage en Absurdie](https://www.bedetheque.com/BD-Olivier-Rameau-Tome-5-Le-grand-voyage-en-Absurdie-10997.html)
        - 1974 
        - tags: #reread
        - NOTES: Notes in the album say this is the apex of the series, and indicate that after this album things change due to the authors getting busy with other projects. But 6 more albums follow, including one published in 2005, and ratings on Bédéthèque are still high. Trip to the real world, in the middle of military exercises. I recognize Greg's dislike of anything military.
    - 2024-07: [Olivier Rameau 4. La caravelle de n'importe où](https://www.bedetheque.com/BD-Olivier-Rameau-Tome-485-La-caravelle-de-n-importe-ou-44927.html)
        - 1973 
        - tags: #reread
        - NOTES: Weird trip to an island full of monsters to reap some special seeds. Colombe is a stowaway. The bad pirate who was bothering her is (spoiler) eaten by a shark. The ship's captain is quite amoral.

    - NOTES: I read this for the last time in 2017. For some reason, I really like this album, while it doesn't have the best reviews on Bédéthèque. Or rather, reviews are split. I can certainly relate to the topic of skiing, being a skier myself. Skiing is not obviously misrepresented, as is the case in other bandes dessinées (as much as I like Lefranc's "Le mystère Borg", the skiing there is a little awkward).

        - "Scuola di media": Angus teaches journalism to Paperino and Paperoga.
        - "Tutto a rovescio": A ray that can reverse everything.
        - "Il boss dei boss": PK joins the mafia but eventually tricks them.
        - "Problemi d'immagine": PK trades appearance with Spennacchiotto (a [old character](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spennacchiotto) who only occasionally reappears).

    - Scénario: Jean Van Hamme
    - Dessin: Christian Cailleaux, Étienne Schréder
    - Rating: 3/5
    - NOTES: It is hard to evaluate this volume. On one hand, it must reproduce the spirit of the original "Rayon U" from the 1940s. That is an album that reflects its time. I like it, but it is not exactly a masterpiece. On the other hand, it needs to provide good art, and a story interesting enough to justify the effort. The art of "La flèche ardente" is not bad, but I noticed some inconsistencies in the faces of the characters, which I found a little unsettling. Now the story itself is fine, without being extraordinary. I was surprised by how Marduk, the scientist, suddenly got world domination ambitions when he realizes the power in his hands. In the end Hollis appears to calm Marduk's ambitions. For now, I will consider this a middle-of-the road album.

    - NOTES:
        - I bought the "Esquisse d'une oeuvre", the large format album, with a dossier in the end.
        - I had bought this a while ago, and for some reason deferred its reading.
        - This again could have been Leloup's last work, but not only it is not, but album 31 is coming out soon.
        - There is no doubt that the art is still suffering from Leloup's old age, especially the characters' faces. The decor are still great, although, like in most of Yoko's space adventures, they tend to be less sophisticated than those of the earth adventure's.
        - This said, looking at the original drawings, not inked, the art tends to be better than the final result. The inking seems to be a problem for Leloup now. Maybe he could have outsourced this part of the work.
        - Again, reading Roger Leloup's explanations helps understand this album. It is anchored in the idea of the Vinéens' early Earth colonization and mistakes they made, in this case genetic modifications. Interestingly enough, there is also an AI aspect, but Leloup had AI way before these days' LLMs were fashionable.
