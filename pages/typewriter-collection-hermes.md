# Typewriter Collection: Hermes Typewriters

## Introduction

As a native of Switzerland, I am a little partial to Hermes typewriters (which, of course, were designed and made there). This said, I truly love the look and feel of these machines. In particular, a 1970 "boxy" Hermes 3000 and a 1946 Media 2000 are some of my favorite typewriters.

I would love to eventually complete my collection with:

- a very early Hermes Baby
- a Hermes 6
- a Hermes 8 or 9
- a Hermes 10
- a Hermes Ambassador with carbon ribbon
- a Hermes Ambassador electric

In the meanwhile, this page presents my collection of 20 Hermes typewriters as of April 2025. 

## The collection
