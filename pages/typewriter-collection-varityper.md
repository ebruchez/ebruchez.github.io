# Typewriter Collection: Varityper

## Introduction

I have accumulated a few Varitypers [^naming] over the years. For a nice introduction to the Varityper in general, see [Richard Polt's Varityper page](https://site.xavier.edu/polt/typewriters/varityper.html).

I have taken a particular interest in these machines, collecting a few, and I am still looking for more, as well as more shuttles/fonts. See my [Typewriter bucket list](/pages/typewriter-bucket-list/) for more.

## Collection

The following table summarizes the collection:

| Branding               | Model                | Date  | Misc             | Electric | Justifying | Differential | Paint   |
|------------------------|----------------------|-------|------------------|----------|------------|--------------|---------|
| VARITYPER Incorporated | Folding              | 1927  | Hammond Patents  | N        | N          | N            | Glossy  |
| VARITYPER Incorporated | 1st electric version | 1930s | mathematical     | Y        | N          | N            | Glossy  |

    <figcaption>1927 - This beautiful Varityper Folding, labeled "VARITYPER INCORPORATED" is essentially identical to the Hammond Folding, and even shows a "Hammond Patents" label. This machine has sign of previous paint touch-ups, and dirty key legends. But it has been cleaned as well as possible and looks pretty good.</figcaption>
</figure>
<figure>
    <img src="/assets/pages/typewriter-varityper/IMG_9971.jpg"/>
    <figcaption>1930s - This Varityper, like the Folding machine, is also labeled "VARITYPER INCORPORATED". However, this is not a folding machine, but one of the first electrified versions. Its smooth black paint contrasts with later machines. This instance has a mathematical keyboard with 4-row shuttles. It is in beautiful cosmetic condition, but needs fixing its carriage return lever. It does not support right-margin justification.</figcaption>
</figure>
<figure>
    <img src="/assets/pages/typewriter-varityper/IMG_9103.jpg"/>
    <figcaption>1940s - This 9-inch machine is now labeled "VARI-TYPER", and the name "Ralph C. Coxhead" appears. Based on a catalog, this matches the "Secretarial" model name. It does not support right-margin justification. This machine needs refurbishing.</figcaption>
</figure>
<figure>
    <img src="/assets/pages/typewriter-varityper/IMG_2882.jpg"/>
    <figcaption>1940s - This 20-inch machine, model A-20, is also labeled "VARI-TYPER". This is a parts machine which I have almost entirely disassembled with the idea of doing a full restoration. It does supports right-margin justification.</figcaption>
</figure>
<figure>
    <img src="/assets/pages/typewriter-varityper/IMG_4989.jpg"/>
    <figcaption>1940s - This 20-inch machine, model A-20, is also labeled "VARI-TYPER". This machine is in very good condition, but needs refurbishing. It does supports right-margin justification.</figcaption>
</figure>
<figure>
    <img src="/assets/pages/typewriter-varityper/IMG_3360.jpg"/>
    <figcaption>1950s - This beautiful VariTyper (notice yet another name variation) is a model 610 F. The "F" indicates the "forms" function for creating lines, embodied in the box to the right of the machine. It  supports right-margin justification and proportional (differential) fonts, two capabilities that Varityper named "DSJ" (Differential Spacing and Justifying). This machine is refurbished.</figcaption>
</figure>
<figure>
    <img src="/assets/pages/typewriter-varityper/IMG_4254.jpg"/>
    <figcaption>1950x - This is an "Engineering" machine, which supports neither justification nor proportional spacing. It is in very poor condition, and might not be salvageable. However, some fonts from its drawer were rescued.</figcaption>
</figure>
<figure>
    <img src="/assets/pages/typewriter-varityper/IMG_4228.jpg"/>
    <figcaption>1988 - As a bonus, this is a CPU board for the AM Varityper EPICS system. This board is based on the MC 68000 microprocessor. By that time, Varityper was still producing machines in the domain of cold typesetting, but these machines had become in effect computers.</figcaption>

[^naming]: As shown in the descriptions, the name Varityper had a few different spellings and capitalization over time.
