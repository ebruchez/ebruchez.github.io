# Computer bucket list

## Introduction

In addition to my [typewriter collection](https://typewriterdatabase.com/typewriters.php?hunter_search=3614&collection_search=My+Collection) and my [typewriter bucket list](../typewriter-bucket-list/), I also collect vintage computer-related items. Here are some I'd love to find.

## DEC VT-100

DEC made over a million of [DEC VT-100](https://terminals-wiki.org/wiki/index.php/DEC_VT100) (see also [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VT100)), so surely there is one waiting for me out there!

## Lear Siegler ADM-3A

The [Lear Siegler ADM-3A](https://terminals-wiki.org/wiki/index.php/Lear_Siegler_ADM-3A) (see also [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADM-3A)) is another iconic terminal, which I'd love to find. Those are still around, but not super common. I love that these machines are made with all discrete logic, and no microcontroller or microprocessor, unlike the TeleVideo terminals (which had an Intel 8035 MCU and later a 6502 CPU) or the VT-100 (which had an Intel 8080 CPU).

Jerry Walker has amazing video series on that terminal, and Usagi Electric has a restoration video as well.

## DEC VT-52 and VT-220

The VT-52 and VT-220 are also iconic terminals, be it only because they are still emulated by terminal emulation software.

## Smaky 8

I own a Smaky 130, as Swiss-made and designed microcomputer. I'd love to find the first 68000-based machine, the Smaky 8. However, only a very small number of those were made. At least one is at the [Bolo Computer Museum](https://www.museebolo.ch/) in Switzerland.

## Smaky 6

The Smaky 6 was a Z80-based machine, and the first Smaky to be produced in "large" numbers (about 450 units). It's the first computer on which I wrote a small working program, in 1986.

## Olivetti Programma 101

This is probably a very long shot, but I'd love to find an affordable Olivetti Programma 101, the first desktop computer ever produced, all the way back in 1965.

*UPDATE: One sold on eBay in September 2023 for $7,408.49. So I won't hold my breath about finding a cheap one.*

## Bucket list items I am lucky to own

### Teletype ASR-33

Ever since I watched [CuriousMarc's series of videos on the ASR-33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzfjT1mCRww&list=PL-_93BVApb5-84G5kmgfuu7TQduTMc73H), I wanted one. And in August 2022, I obtained three of them, in various conditions! One of them is being restored, as pictured here:

### TeleVideo terminals

I own a TeleVideo TVI-912 from 1979. See the following posts:

- [The TeleVideo TVI-912 terminal - Part 1](/posts/televideo-912-terminal-1/)
- [The TeleVideo TVI-912 terminal - Part 2](/posts/televideo-912-terminal-2/)
- [The TeleVideo TVI-912 terminal - Part 3](/posts/televideo-912-terminal-3/)

![TeleVideo TVI-912](/assets/posts/televideo-912/2x/IMG_4030.jpg){:standalone style="max-width: 75%; width="100%"}

I also own a TeleVideo TS-800A (TVI-950-compatible, and includes a CP-M system) from 1983, see the following blog post:

- [Restoring a TeleVideo TS-800A Terminal](/posts/televideo-800a-terminal/))

![TeleVideo TS-800A](/assets/posts/televideo-800a/2x/IMG_6693.jpg){:standalone style="max-width: 75%; width="100%"}

Those can be connected to vintage computers. I have a CompuPro System 8/16, but it's not working yet. In the meanwhile, I have connected them to an [Altair-Duino](https://adwaterandstir.com/product/altair-8800-emulator-kit/) kit and a [PiDP-11](https://obsolescence.wixsite.com/obsolescence/pidp-11) kit via RSR-232.[^rs232]

[^rs232]: The ASR-33 has a current loop interface, which is not compatible with RS-232. However, there are adapters available.
