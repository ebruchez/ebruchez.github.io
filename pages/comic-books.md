# Comic Books

## Background

I grew up reading lots of comic books (AKA "bandes dessinées"). I read lots of [Franco-Belgian comics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franco-Belgian_comics) including classics known all around the world, such as Tintin and Asterix, but also Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck which of course originate from the US. I am not a huge fan of the [superhero comics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superhero_comics) or [manga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manga), but that might still come. I do like some American comic strips, including Peanuts and Calvin and Hobbes.

## Favorite comic books

### Individual works

- [Maus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maus), by Art Spiegelman
- [Le Cycle de Cyann](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Cycle_de_Cyann), by François Bourgeon
- [Le dernier chant des Malaterre](http://www.bedetheque.com/BD-Compagnons-du-crepuscule-Tome-3-Le-dernier-chant-des-Malaterre-142.html), by François Bourgeon. This is the third part of *Les compagnons du crépuscule*, and contains some of the most amazing art I have ever seen.
- [Les Cités obscures](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Cit%C3%A9s_obscures), by Schuiten and Peeters
- Donald Duck and Uncle Scrooge stories, by [Don Rosa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Rosa)
- [La vie comme elle vient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_vie_comme_elle_vient_(Lapinot)), by [Lewis Trondheim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Trondheim). This is part of his series *Les formidables aventures de Lapinot*.
- [L'incal](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27Incal), Alejandro Jodorowsky and Moebius's masterpiece.

### Among the classics

- Tintin, by Hergé
- Asterix
- Yoko Tsuno
    - One particularity of this series is that the hero is a woman and women constitute the majority of the important characters of the stories (even though the author, Roger Leloup, is a man). This never bothered me the least as a boy and, as an adult, I still love the series.
- [Achille Talon](https://www.bedetheque.com/serie-33-BD-Achille-Talon.html)
    - This series has been a favorite of mine ever since I encountered it (only the original albums by Greg).
    - It is probably impossible to translate this to English or other languages. The humor is often tied to the French language. Greg even went to the US for a while to promote his character, but it failed.
- Alix
    - Jacques Martin created this genre where the story takes place during the Roman antiquity.
    - He started with Alix, and then created a modern version of the character with Lefranc (below).
- Lefranc
    - The other major character created by Jacques Martin.
    - Some of the stories in this series are just very good.
    - My favorite might be [Le Repaire du loup](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Repaire_du_loup), drawn by Bob de Moor, which is a masterpiece of the genre. Unfortunately, de Moor was not allowed by the Studios Hergé to continue working on Lefranc.
- Blake et Mortimer (the original series)
    - You can just read and re-read these albums without ever tiring of them.
- [Thorgal](https://www.bedetheque.com/serie-12-BD-Thorgal.html)
    - This is a excellent series which mixes northern mythology, science-fiction at times, always with adventure.
    - The art by Grzegorz Rosiński has evolved over time from album 1 to album 36 (1980 to 2018). Album 37, from 2019, features a new cartoonist, Fred Vignaux.
    - Jean Van Hamme (1-29), Yves Sente (30-34), Xavier Dorison (35), Yann (36-37).
