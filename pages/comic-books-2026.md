# Comic Books (2026)

- 2026-01-26: [Donjon Parade - 2. Le sage du ghetto](https://www.bedetheque.com/BD-Donjon-Parade-Tome-2-Le-sage-du-ghetto-6299.html)
    - 2001
    - language: French
    - Scénario: Lewis Trondheim
    - Dessin: Manu Larcenet
    - NOTES: Again, like tome 1, the story is really short at 30 pages. A story about segregation (the title gives it away) and extreme cruelty from the dog, the Duc de Clérembard, but also about the immense stupidity of those who accept to be oppressed and ask for more. Humor, of course, going to the ghetto.
- 2026-01-16: [Lustiges Taschenbuch Sommer 13: Sommergeschichten](https://www.lustiges-taschenbuch.de/ausgaben/nebenreihen/sommer/band-13)
    - 2023
    - Language: German
    - NOTES: Practicing my German reading a little.
- 2026-01-09: [Blake et Mortimer - 23. Le bâton de Plutarque](https://www.bedetheque.com/BD-Blake-et-Mortimer-Tome-23-Le-Baton-de-Plutarque-226934.html)
    - Language: French
    - tags: #reread
    - NOTES:
        - Previous notes: A prequel to "Le secret de l'Espadon". Involves Blake and Mortimer meeting again; the two secret bases of Scaw-Fell and Hormuz; Bletchley Park; and an early encounter with Olrik.
        - Not a bad story, but one which suffers a little from over-explaining things: where did Blake and Mortimer meet; why are they preparing for WWIII against Basam-Damdu; where does Olrik come from; etc.
- 2026-01-04: [Les cités obscures - H11. Souvenirs de l'Éternel Présent](https://www.bedetheque.com/BD-Cites-obscures-H11-Souvenirs-de-l-Eternel-Present-26801.html)
    - 1993/2009
    - tags: #reread
    - Language: French
    - Scénario: Benoît Peeters
    - Dessin: François Schuiten
    - NOTES:
        - I had forgotten most of this, last reread in 2020. As I noted them, this is based on the sketches for the movie Taxandria.
        - The world is in the spirit of the Cités Obscures. Human activity is absurd (see the tram pullers and pushers). The world is initially unexplained.
        - The story:
            - A long time ago, Taxandria became prosperous thanks to scientific developments.
            - But the rulers, president Brentano and his wife Irina, decided to bring the scientific achievements, but also the Taxandrian system of governance, to other places.
            - Their power was, however, unchecked; their hubris, huge; and their decisions, arbitrary and incompetent.
            - Irina directs scientists to create a duplicating machine. They succeed, and end up duplicating Irina, but also the sun. A huge tsunami destroys the country, kills most, and that is the end of that society.
            - New rulers outlaw science, machines, books, and references to the past or the future. The world becomes, however, absurd, poor, and childless.
            - The hero, Aimé, a young, bald boy, is, however, curious, and wants answers about everything. He finds a book, learns about the events, and ends up at Marinum, where he wanted to see the sea.
            - The sea, there, is long gone, replaced by a desert. He proceeds further and finally finds the sea, almost drowns, and is rescued by fishermen.
            - He says he came from Taxandria and Marinum, but they say there is nothing where he is pointing to. That's the end of the story.
        - The art is great, as usual. The story is less intriguing than other Cités Obscures stories. You'd like to know more about Aimé's fate, in particular.
