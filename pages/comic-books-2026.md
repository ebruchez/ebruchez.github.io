# Comic Books (2026)

- 2026-02-10: [Sillage - 24. Concessions](https://www.bedetheque.com/BD-Sillage-Tome-24-Concessions-507102.html)
    - 2024
    - Language: French 
    - Scénario: Philippe Buchet
    - Dessin et couleur: Philippe Buchet
    - NOTES: Nice atmosphere on a world with Western inspiration. Some discoveries about the metamorphs, but that story goes very slowly. The idea of an alternative, paradisiac underground world is interesting, but the pacing of the story and the explanations is a little clumsy.

    - [Qui est ce Schtroumpf?](https://www.bedetheque.com/BD-Schtroumpfs-par-Tome-1-Qui-est-ce-Schtroumpf-472153.html)

- 2026-02-09: [Donjon monsters, tome 3. La Carte majeure](https://www.bedetheque.com/BD-Donjon-Monsters-Tome-3-La-Carte-majeure-21043.html)
    - 2002
    - language: French
    - Scénario: Lewis Trondheim, Joann Sfar
    - Dessin: Andreas
    - NOTES: This fits just after Armaggedon. 
- 2026-02-07: [https://www.bedetheque.com/BD-Olivier-Rameau-INT3-Integrale-3-130021.html)
    - [Olivier Rameau 9. Le canon de la bonne humeur](https://www.bedetheque.com/BD-Olivier-Rameau-Tome-9-Le-canon-de-la-bonne-humeur-10995.html)
        - 1983
        - NOTES: The Poyoutouffus turn out to be spreading a pollen causing bad mood. This is unacceptable for Rêverose. A special cannon ends up being the solution to spread love and good mood. The Poyoutouffus lose their hair and start loving each other and the rest of Rêverose. 
    - [Olivier Rameau 8. La trompette du silence](https://www.bedetheque.com/BD-Olivier-Rameau-Tome-8-La-trompette-du-silence-56026.html)
        - 1978
        - NOTES: A big trumpet-shaped mountain starts making noises, which stun people. Olivier and the others must find what is going on. They discover that a tiny creature is the origin of the noise, and a sort of concert hall. The introduction is pretty nice, with Olivier and Colombe naked (but with leaves covering them), just enjoying nature and water.
    -  [Olivier Rameau 7. Le miroir à trois faces](https://www.bedetheque.com/BD-Olivier-Rameau-Tome-7-Le-miroir-a-trois-faces-46254.html)
        - 1977
        - NOTES: Rêverose is threatened by Schnarkbuls, sort of empty being that can appear as the doubles of existing beings. They do this by using mirrors, hidden in the forest of Pas-Permis. The root mirror is destroyed, and all is well.
- 2026-01-26: [Donjon Parade - 2. Le sage du ghetto](https://www.bedetheque.com/BD-Donjon-Parade-Tome-2-Le-sage-du-ghetto-6299.html)
    - 2001
    - language: French
    - Scénario: Lewis Trondheim
    - Dessin: Manu Larcenet
    - NOTES: Again, like tome 1, the story is really short at 30 pages. A story about segregation (the title gives it away) and extreme cruelty from the dog, the Duc de Clérembard, but also about the immense stupidity of those who accept to be oppressed and ask for more. Humor, of course, going to the ghetto.
- 2026-01-16: [Lustiges Taschenbuch Sommer 13: Sommergeschichten](https://www.lustiges-taschenbuch.de/ausgaben/nebenreihen/sommer/band-13)
    - 2023
    - Language: German
    - NOTES: Practicing my German reading a little.
- 2026-01-09: [Blake et Mortimer - 23. Le bâton de Plutarque](https://www.bedetheque.com/BD-Blake-et-Mortimer-Tome-23-Le-Baton-de-Plutarque-226934.html)
    - Language: French
    - tags: #reread
    - NOTES:
        - Previous notes: A prequel to "Le secret de l'Espadon". Involves Blake and Mortimer meeting again; the two secret bases of Scaw-Fell and Hormuz; Bletchley Park; and an early encounter with Olrik.
        - Not a bad story, but one which suffers a little from over-explaining things: where did Blake and Mortimer meet; why are they preparing for WWIII against Basam-Damdu; where does Olrik come from; etc.
- 2026-01-04: [Les cités obscures - H11. Souvenirs de l'Éternel Présent](https://www.bedetheque.com/BD-Cites-obscures-H11-Souvenirs-de-l-Eternel-Present-26801.html)
    - 1993/2009
    - tags: #reread
    - Language: French
    - Scénario: Benoît Peeters
    - Dessin: François Schuiten
    - NOTES:
        - I had forgotten most of this, last reread in 2020. As I noted them, this is based on the sketches for the movie Taxandria.
        - The world is in the spirit of the Cités Obscures. Human activity is absurd (see the tram pullers and pushers). The world is initially unexplained.
        - The story:
            - A long time ago, Taxandria became prosperous thanks to scientific developments.
            - But the rulers, president Brentano and his wife Irina, decided to bring the scientific achievements, but also the Taxandrian system of governance, to other places.
            - Their power was, however, unchecked; their hubris, huge; and their decisions, arbitrary and incompetent.
            - Irina directs scientists to create a duplicating machine. They succeed, and end up duplicating Irina, but also the sun. A huge tsunami destroys the country, kills most, and that is the end of that society.
            - New rulers outlaw science, machines, books, and references to the past or the future. The world becomes, however, absurd, poor, and childless.
            - The hero, Aimé, a young, bald boy, is, however, curious, and wants answers about everything. He finds a book, learns about the events, and ends up at Marinum, where he wanted to see the sea.
            - The sea, there, is long gone, replaced by a desert. He proceeds further and finally finds the sea, almost drowns, and is rescued by fishermen.
            - He says he came from Taxandria and Marinum, but they say there is nothing where he is pointing to. That's the end of the story.
        - The art is great, as usual. The story is less intriguing than other Cités Obscures stories. You'd like to know more about Aimé's fate, in particular.
