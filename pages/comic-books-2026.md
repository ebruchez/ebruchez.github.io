    - Scénario: Benoît Peeters
    - Dessin: François Schuiten
    - NOTES:
        - I had forgotten most of this, last reread in 2020. As I noted them, this is based on the sketches for the movie Taxandria.
        - The world is in the spirit of the Cités Obscures. Human activity is absurd (see the tram pullers and pushers). The world is initially unexplained.
        - The story:
            - A long time ago, Taxandria became prosperous thanks to scientific developments.
            - But the rulers, president Brentano and his wife Irina, decided to bring the scientific achievements, but also the Taxandrian system of governance, to other places.
            - Their power was, however, unchecked; their hubris, huge; and their decisions, arbitrary and incompetent.
            - Irina directs scientists to create a duplicating machine. They succeed, and end up duplicating Irina, but also the sun. A huge tsunami destroys the country, kills most, and that is the end of that society.
            - New rulers outlaw science, machines, books, and references to the past or the future. The world becomes, however, absurd, poor, and childless.
            - The hero, Aimé, a young, bald boy, is, however, curious, and wants answers about everything. He finds a book, learns about the events, and ends up at Marinum, where he wanted to see the sea.
            - The sea, there, is long gone, replaced by a desert. He proceeds further and finally finds the sea, almost drowns, and is rescued by fishermen.
            - He says he came from Taxandria and Marinum, but they say there is nothing where he is pointing to. That's the end of the story.
        - The art is great, as usual. The story is less intriguing than other Cités Obscures stories. You'd like to know more about Aimé's fate, in particular.
