# Typewriter collection: IBM Typewriters

## Introduction

I collect IBM typewriters, including:

- __IBM Selectric__: Machines in this family introduced in 1961 are the best known and feature the famous “golf ball” single type element.
- __Typebar typewriters:__ This family of typewriters started with IBM's acquisition of Electromatic. A subset of this family are _Executive_ models, that feature proportional spacing and carbon ribbon.
- __Electronic typewriters:__ Machines using electronics include the MT/SC, Mag Card and Mag Card II families, and Electronic Typewriter families.
- __Wheelwriter:__ The Wheelwriter family features a daisy wheel. This said, I don't own a Wheelwriter yet!

This page presents my collection of 25 IBM typewriters as of April 2025 (excluding a couple of parts machines), covering almost 45 years of history. The collection includes uncommon machines, as well as the rare, and possibly unique, IBM MT/SC system. For more, read [The IBM Magnetic Tape Selectric Composer - Part 1](/posts/ibm-mt-sc-1/).
