<figure><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ebruchez/public/master/Blog%20posts/images/2014-10-02-tmobile-700.jpg" alt="T-Mobile SIM Kit" id="main-image" class="responsive-image" /><figcaption>T-Mobile SIM Kit</figcaption></figure> <p><em>TL;DR: If you have the cash to buy an unlocked iPhone 6 upfront, don&#8217;t mind running on the T-Mobile network, and mostly care about data as opposed to voice, you can save well over $500 over a period of two years compared to mainstream plans by AT&amp;T, Verizon or even T-Mobile&#8217;s flagship plans.</em></p> <p><em>NOTE: The following post is specific to the US smartphone market.</em></p> <p>Over the last 2 years I have been on an AT&amp;T business plan <a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a> which was not a bad deal by US standards:</p> <ul><li>Upfront cost for the iPhone 5: $363.74 <a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[2]</a></li><li>Monthly cost: $74 ($69.99 plus taxes, fees and phone subsidy)</li><li>Monthly data: 3 GB</li><li>Contract duration: 2 years</li></ul> <p>I usually stayed under the included 3 GB, but occasionally went over and had to pay an extra $10 for an additional 1 GB. I made very limited use of voice and text.</p> <p>As I wanted to get a new <a href="http://blog.bruchez.name/2014/09/rationalizing-iphone-6-plus.html">iPhone 6 Plus</a>, I considered my options. With that same AT&amp;T business plan, here is what the cost would have been for the next 2 years:</p> <ul><li>Upfront cost for the iPhone 6 Plus 64 GB: $435.91 ($399 + tax) <a href="#fn:2" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[2]</a></li><li>Monthly cost: $74</li><li>Monthly data: 3 GB</li><li>Contract duration: 2 years</li><li>Total cost of ownership: $2,211.90 ($92 / month)</li></ul> <p>The price of an unlocked iPhone 6 Plus 64 GB, bought directly from Apple, is $927.53 ($849.00 without sales tax). If we spread the total cost over 2 years, we get the following breakdown:</p> <ul><li>Monthly device payment: $927.53 / 24 = $38.65</li><li>Monthly service cost: $92 - $38.65 = $53.35</li></ul> <p>Looking at the monthly cost over the same period of time is useful as it allows us to do meaningful comparisons.</p> <p>Now let&#8217;s look at the <a href="http://www.t-mobile.com/cell-phone-plans/individual.html">T-Mobile plans</a> advertised for the iPhone 6. They give you quite a bit (unlimited talk, text and data with data throttling), but they are not cheap: they range from $50 to $80 per month, &#8220;plus taxes, fees and monthly device payment&#8221;, that is <em>without phone subsidy</em>. They mainly differ by the amount of 4G LTE data you get (from 1 GB to unlimited, and then &#8220;your data speed will automatically convert to up to 2G web speeds for the remainder of your billing cycle&#8221;). <a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[3]</a></p> <p>For my data usage I would probably need the $60 plan (which, remember, doesn&#8217;t include taxes and fees, so is probably at least $65 in practice) to have something equivalent to my AT&amp;T plan. This is about $12 more per month ($288 more over 24 months) than my previous AT&amp;T service.</p> <p>In short, T-Mobile is not a particularly good deal if you care mostly about 4G data. <a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[4]</a> And, by the way, AT&amp;T now has comparable prices as well.</p> <p>But luckily there is more: T-Mobile also offers <a href="http://prepaid-phones.t-mobile.com/prepaid-plans">prepaid plans</a>. And although the flagship prepaid plans that T-Mobile advertises are the same as their regular plans, you will find, hidden in plain sight, the following:</p> <blockquote><p>$30 per month - Unlimited web and text with 100 minutes talk</p> <p>100 minutes talk | Unlimited text | First 5 GB at up to 4G speeds</p> <p>Now get unlimited international texting from the U.S. to virtually anywhere included in your plan—at no extra charge.</p> <p>This plan is only available for devices purchased from Wal-Mart or devices activated on T-Mobile.com</p></blockquote> <p>I had heard of this plan from friends who have been using it for quite a while with Android phones. T-Mobile clearly doesn&#8217;t want you to know too much about this: it is a little bit buried, and details of the plan are lacking. But it&#8217;s there! <a href="#fn:5" id="fnref:5" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[5]</a></p> <p>The question now is: does this work with the iPhone 6 Plus? The answer is yes, it does work! Here is what you have to do:</p> <ol><li>Buy your unlocked (&#8220;Contract-free for use on T-Mobile&#8221;) iPhone 6 (or 6 Plus) from Apple. <a href="#fn:6" id="fnref:6" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[6]</a></li><li>Order the T-Mobile <a href="http://prepaid-phones.t-mobile.com/prepaid-phone/T-Mobile-Nano-SIM-Card-Prepaid">SIM Starter Kit with nano SIM</a>. The kit is $10 but T-Mobile sometimes has promotions (I bought the kit for one cent).</li><li>Don&#8217;t activate the T-Mobile SIM which comes with your iPhone. <a href="#fn:7" id="fnref:7" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[7]</a></li><li>Once you receive the SIM, place it in your iPhone.</li><li>Proceed with activation online <a href="#fn:8" id="fnref:8" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[8]</a> and choose the $30 plan. <a href="#fn:9" id="fnref:9" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[9]</a></li><li>Profit!!!</li></ol> <p>So now let&#8217;s look at the total cost of ownership of this solution over two years:</p> <ul><li>iPhone 6 Plus 64 GB, unlocked, with sales tax: $927.53</li><li>Monthly cost of plan: $30 <a href="#fn:10" id="fnref:10" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[10]</a></li><li>Monthly data: 5 GB</li><li>Total provider cost over 2 years: $30 × 24 = $720</li><li>Total cost per month including the iPhone: $68.65</li><li>Total cost of ownership: $1,647.53</li><li>Savings over my earlier AT&amp;T plan over 2 years: $564.38</li></ul> <p>Of course, this is still not <em>cheap</em> overall, but it&#8217;s a bit better, and in addition I get:</p> <ul><li>2 GB more 4G data per month than with the AT&amp;T business plan</li><li>tethering <a href="#fn:11" id="fnref:11" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[11]</a></li><li>an unlocked phone which I can use on many networks around the world</li><li>no contract commitment whatsoever</li><li>the ability to upgrade the phone at any time (just sell it and buy a new one!)</li><li>the pleasure of giving money to a company a little bit less evil than AT&amp;T and Verizon</li></ul> <p>There are drawbacks to this solution, in particular:</p> <ul><li>It is unclear whether I could have ported my phone number and still qualify for a &#8220;new activation&#8221;. I did not try it because I use <a href="https://support.google.com/voice/answer/115061?hl=en">Google Voice</a> to forward my calls anyway.</li><li>You are on the T-Mobile network, and this means that you won&#8217;t have as much coverage as with AT&amp;T or Verizon.</li><li>This can be seen as a benefit or a drawback: you have to pay upfront for the phone, and T-Mobile won&#8217;t help you pay for it when you get prepaid plans.</li><li>There are way less voice minutes (an option to call regular phones is using Skype, Google Hangouts, or other VoIP solutions).</li><li>It is unclear whether fancy features such as Wi-Fi calling <a href="#fn:12" id="fnref:12" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[12]</a> or VoLTE are or will be enabled. But since these are voice features and this solution is for people who care more about data than voice, it doesn&#8217;t matter much to me.</li></ul> <p>No matter what, I will see how this fares over the next few months, and in the meanwhile I hope this post will be useful to others!</p> <p><em>Disclaimer: This has been working for friends with Android phones and appears to be working for me so far with the iPhone 6 Plus, but I cannot be held responsible if you go this route and have issues of any kind.</em></p> <hr /> <p>For another article comparing plans by major providers, see <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/tech/iphone-6-plans-compared-at-t-verizon-sprint-and-97601904249.html">iPhone 6 Plans Compared: AT&amp;T, Verizon, Sprint, and T-Mobile</a>. Keep in mind that this looks at and iPhone 6, not 6 Plus (so about $100 of difference) and only 2 GB / month plans.</p> <div class="footnotes"><hr /><ol> <li id="fn:1"><p>If you have a company, I recommend you ask AT&amp;T about these plans. You have great customer support, and contrary to business cable, you get more for your money compared with consumer plans. <a href="#fnref:1" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p></li> <li id="fn:2"><p>This is of course <em>not</em> the full price of the phone. It is a downpayment you make on it, and you pay for your phone as part of your monthly plan, in ways which until recently were usually not detailed by providers. <a href="#fnref:2" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p></li> <li id="fn:3"><p>T-Mobile also has a &#8220;Simple Starter 2GB Plan&#8221; for $45/month, which includes 2 GB of 4G LTE data, but then cuts out your data. This is not really an option for me. <a href="#fnref:3" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p></li> <li id="fn:4"><p>T-Mobile also has <a href="https://business.t-mobile.com/plans">business plans</a>, but for one line the prices are the same. <a href="#fnref:4" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p></li> <li id="fn:5"><p>In fact, it is surprising that they even have this plan at all on their site. It makes sense at Wal-Mart, but online? Could it be that they legally have to list it on their site if they provide it at Wal-Mart? I would be curious to know. <a href="#fnref:5" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p></li> <li id="fn:6"><p>That&#8217;s what I did. It might be the same if you get it from T-Mobile, but I haven&#8217;t tried. <a href="#fnref:6" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p></li> <li id="fn:7"><p>I didn&#8217;t try to activate it, but I suspect that the activation instructions would lead you to the regular T-Mobile plans without including the $30 prepaid plan. Since the SIM kit was $ 0.01, I figured I would go the safer route. But even for $10 the price remains reasonable. <a href="#fnref:7" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p></li> <li id="fn:8"><p>Ignore the voice-based activation which starts when you turn on the phone. Also, I had some trouble with Chrome and then switched to Firefox. <a href="#fnref:8" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p></li> <li id="fn:9"><p>The plan is marked &#8220;for new activations only&#8221;, and I am not sure what it means, although by any definition of &#8220;new activation&#8221; I can think of, mine was a &#8220;new activation&#8221;. <a href="#fnref:9" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p></li> <li id="fn:10"><p>And by the way the plan is a round $30 per month: there is are no additional taxes or fees. <a href="#fnref:10" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p></li> <li id="fn:11"><p>With some devices, such as the Nexus 5, tethering is disabled by T-Mobile, while it works fine with the Nexus 4. It is entirely possible that T-Mobile will disable tethering on the iPhone 6 when they get to it. But for now it works. <a href="#fnref:11" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p></li> <li id="fn:12"><p>Although the T-Mobile site says &#8220;WiFi Calling for all T-Mobile customers with a capable device&#8221;. <a href="#fnref:12" title="return to article" class="reversefootnote">&#160;&#8617;</a></p></li> </ol></div>
