Unfortunately, it is broken on Leopard. Version 0.2 doesn't start anymore at all. The good news is that the author is <a href="http://sbooth.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=12&amp;t=1776">working on it</a>. In fact, the latest builds (using r1057 at the moment) at least start and seem to, well, play, but I don't seem to be able to import anything into the Play library, for example.<br /><br />As good as Play will eventually be on Leopard (and it is likely to remain a much more lightweight alternative to iTunes), Apple really needs to support FLAC. Who needs the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Lossless">Apple Lossless</a> format anyway? So go Apple, put an engineer on it for a few days and support FLAC already.
