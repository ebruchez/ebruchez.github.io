<div class="p1"><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/05/worlds-first-cruelty-free-hamburger">The world's first cruelty-free hamburger</a></div><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">My own view is that being a vegetarian or vegan is not an end in itself, but a means towards reducing both human and animal suffering, and leaving a habitable planet to future generations.</blockquote><div class="p1">I am not a vegetarian but I try not to eat too much meat - when I think about it. If tomorrow all meat consumption was prohibited, I would probably just shrug. Sure, I would miss a little bit <a href="http://www.myswitzerland.com/en-us/valais-air-dried-beef-igp-sublime.html">dried meat from Valais</a> and the occasional filet mignon. But given the positive impact on animal suffering and the environment, that would be well worth it.</div><div class="p1"><br /></div><div class="p1">But I agree with the author that it's not the meat itself, it's how we get to the meat. If there was a way to enjoy the taste without the pain, and no particular adverse health effects, I would see no reason not to eat meat at least occasionally. But of course that would be a personal choice.</div>
