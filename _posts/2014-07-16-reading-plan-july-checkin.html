<p>My <a href="http://blog.bruchez.name/2014/06/reading-plan-june-1-checkin.html">goals for the month of June</a> were:</p> <ul><li>spend 3 quality hours</li><li>complete synthesis of the organ book</li></ul> <p>I spent 5 hours in June, which is good as that means I did more than planned! However that was not enough to complete that synthesis.</p> <p>It&#8217;s already mid-July and I have spent another hour on the synthesis. For the rest of the month, I will continue on the synthesis and try to have a closure on it, spending about 2 more hours.</p> <p>For next month, I want to separate the tasks:</p> <ul><li>planned <em>reading</em></li><li><em>writing</em> about what I read</li></ul> <p>I do not plan to write about all the books I read, certainly not in depth. Still, if I want to read at least one other book this year, I better start doing the <em>reading</em> part regularly, and if <em>writing</em> is needed consider that a separately planned task.</p>
