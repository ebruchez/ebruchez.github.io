Systematically, our recent flight searches have come up with this issue. It seems that this is nothing new and has been going on for years.<br /><br />This is not only irritating, it also removes a lot of the value Orbitz is meant to provide.<br /><br />It's not just that you are out of luck and that the system is temporarily out of sync. After all, even after you check such a flight, it keeps popping up in your searches. And it often does the following day as well.<br /><br />There is certainly a solution to that problem if Orbitz and the airline companies actually want to fix this broken behavior. Given the amount of time this has been going on, I can only assume that it is deliberate.<br /><br />No matter whose fault it is, I am just wondering: how do we users put up with what only amounts to a permanent lie?<br /><br />In the meanwhile, I am trying to book flights directly from the airlines whenever possible. Even though they may be the ones providing the disinformation, I have not hit this issue on their web sites, and I want to send a signal to Orbitz, however small.
