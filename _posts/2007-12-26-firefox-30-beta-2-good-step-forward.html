Firefox 3 is meant to improve a lot on this, thanks to "<a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/3.0b2/releasenotes/">nearly 2 million          lines of code changes</a>" in the new Gecko engine.<br /><br />Add to this the fact that Firefox 3 greatly improves Mac OS X support (Firefox 2 on Mac OS X is sub-par compared to its Windows incarnation, with no native widgets and funny UI bugs), and there is no doubt that it will be a necessary upgrade.<br /><br />My first impression of 3.0 beta 2 is very good: history back/forward is much snappier, as is switching between tabs. Google Reader seems much faster. I have been using the beta for several days without any major problems, except some oddities in the Download Manager, and missing file names when printing to PDF.<br /><br />Compatibility with web sites out there seems excellent, although it is inevitable that issues will arise here or there. In particular, some code in <a href="http://www.orbeon.com/">Orbeon Forms</a> had to be fixed due to Firefox 3 fixing <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=206053">this bug</a>.<br /><br />There are a few disappointments:<br /><ul><li>Printing seems as broken as ever. Safari seems to do much better here, and I suspect that even IE does better, which is a real shame.</li><li>While OS integration is much improved on the Mac with native widgets, it doesn't seem that 3.0 beta 2 is able to use the native spellchecker  or Keychain.<br /></li></ul>In spite of this, Firefox 3 will be a good step forward, and I can't wait for further performance improvements such as the integration of the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/tamarin/">Tamarin</a> VM.
