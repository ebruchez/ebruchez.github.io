Freedom opens the windows of the soul so that man can discover his most profound beliefs and commune with God. Freedom and religion endure together, or perish alone."</span><br /><br />This has to be one of the most nonsensical statements I have read in a while, and I can only qualify it, nicely, as blabber.<br /><br />Freedom has nothing to do with religion. If anything, religion has hindered, and is still hindering, freedom in many parts of the world. America, the land of the free, was <a href="http://skeptically.org/thinkersonreligion/id9.html">founded by atheists</a> (at most Deists) and free-thinkers,  contrary to what too many in America would like you to believe.<br /><br />More generally, ethics do not correlate with religion: many religious people behave in a non-ethical way, and many non-religious people behave in an ethical way. There is lot of wishful thinking, but no evidence that I know of showing otherwise.<br /><br />It is clear that Romney doesn't like to be asked about his religion (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mormonism">Mormonism</a>), which is understandable, but talking nonsense is probably not a good solution to that particular problem: it just makes him sound dumb (which, after all, is fine in my book).
