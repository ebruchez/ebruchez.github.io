My <a href="http://blog.bruchez.name/2014/09/reading-plan-september-checkin.html">goal for the month of September</a> was making progress reading <i>Intuition Pumps and Other Tools for Thinking</i>. I am now at page 60, so I consider that this was a success. It does help to have small, achievable goals!
