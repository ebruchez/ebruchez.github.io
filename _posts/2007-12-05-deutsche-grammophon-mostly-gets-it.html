The web site is reasonably well done for a version 1.0. Search appears to function, album tracks list properly, and the previews are of good quality. My main disappointment is that there is no option to download music in a lossless format such as <a href="http://flac.sourceforge.net/">FLAC</a>, but maybe I am expecting too much.<br /><br />As the web site says, "Over 600 out-of-print CDs are made available again as downloads in this shop." Finally, somebody realizes that in the internet age, nothing should ever get "out-of-print" again.<br /><br />I wish DG much success with this web site, even though it may be too late for the music industry to be rescued, as <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/10/08/yahoos-ian-rogers-to-music-industry-inconvenience-doesnt-scale/">"For the last eight years the industry has been doing nothing more than rearranging the deck chairs on its own musical Titanic."</a>.
