It was clearly not the most reasonable thing to do to stand in line for hours to get an expensive device associated with an expensive 2-year contract with AT&amp;T (which is not a particularly loved company). But hey, all that was known in advance.<br /><br />What in the end amazed me was the quality of the shopping experience at the Palo Alto Apple store. I am not talking about the 6 hours spent standing in line: this was partly due to the activation process, already expected to be extremely slow, and which took a turn for the worse due to Apple and AT&amp;T servers being down. But even that was kind of expected and part of the game.<br /><br />The first thing was the quality and professionalism of the Apple store staff:<br /><ul><li>On that busy day, the two Apple stores I called actually had somebody available to pick up the phone and kindly answer my questions about stock and expected wait time.</li><li>Employees regularly walked up and down the line, offering water and answering questions.</li><li>At the end of the line, every buyer was greeted and personally managed. The usual wireless device used at Apple stores allowed for just picking a convenient spot in the store to talk and handle the registration process.</li><li>The (tired) employees remained amicable and helpful without being obsequious, providing regular updates, although obviously they couldn't do much about the failing servers.</li><li>When the possibility arose that the iPhones could not be activated before the following day and that instead we would get a voucher for the following morning, the store manager individually talked to all the customers affected and shook hands with them.</li></ul>In short everything was designed to make you, the customer, feel treated as well as possible given the circumstances.<br /><br />The second amazing thing is the aura that was put around the iPhone: <br /><ul><li>The iPhone was fetched and brought back to you as if it was a unique jewel, in a nice "iPhone 3G" bag containing the quite beautiful iPhone 3G box.</li><li>You were given the opportunity to open the sealed box yourself before proceeding to activation (see the <a href="http://tinyurl.com/5eqq9z">instructions for the retail employees as </a><a href="http://tinyurl.com/5eqq9z">reported by MacRumors</a>).</li><li>Finally, after all was said and done, the bag was handed back to you like a trophy (and it actually was one in a way given the effort it took to get it).</li></ul>I know, after all, it's really just a phone ("This phone is that important to you?", said a woman passing by the line, "(Sigh) Different generation..."). But with this masterful <span style="font-style: italic;">mise en sc√®ne</span>, you really felt that you went through all this for a good reason. Whoever devised this whole process is a marketing genius.
