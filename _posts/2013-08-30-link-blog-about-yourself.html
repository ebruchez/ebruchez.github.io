<a href="http://danielmiessler.com/about/">Daniel Miessler's About page</a><br /><br />I only discovered Daniel's websites recently, thanks to my brother. It looks like Daniel and I largely share a worldview. The difference, of course, is that his website is excellent, and that he is quite good at expressing himself, something I have yet to improve.<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="background-color: #f8f8f8; color: #222222; font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;tahoma&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , &quot;freesans&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"></span>I'll start by saying that if you've not tried to summarize yourself in this sort of way, i.e. via some sort of "about me" format, you should make an effort to do so. It's quite enlightening to explicitly identify who you are and what you value in life.<span style="background-color: #f8f8f8; color: #222222; font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;tahoma&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , &quot;freesans&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;">&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color: #f8f8f8; color: #222222; font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;tahoma&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , &quot;freesans&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"></span></blockquote>I like that encouragement. I have focused so far on a single <a href="https://github.com/ebruchez/public/blob/master/Wordview.md">Worldview</a> document. But that might not be the best format, or at least not the only format. So now I started updating the <a href="https://github.com/ebruchez/public">README</a> to look a bit more like his About page.<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="background-color: #f8f8f8; color: #222222; font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;tahoma&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , &quot;freesans&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"></span>I see my site as nothing less than a means of augmenting and sharing my mind. I use it as a means of organizing everything I have learned and want to learn, and then as a means of sharing that same content with others.</blockquote>This is very well said and it's exactly what I am trying to do, without having been able to express it that well. I feel encouraged, reading this, to put more content in that space I have created on github.
