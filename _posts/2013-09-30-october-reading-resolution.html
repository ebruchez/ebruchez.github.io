<p>There is a side project which I started last year but which I haven&#8217;t had much time to work on so far. Suffice it to say that it involves researching the history of the organ, and I was recently recommended a must-read book about this by the curator of the <a href="http://www.orgue.ch/">Mus√©e Suisse de l&#8217;Orgue</a> in Switzerland.</p> <p>Thanks to the magic of public libraries, I managed to find the English adaptation of the book (the original French edition seems to have disappeared from the San Francisco Public Library), and to borrow it (via <a href="http://csul.iii.com/screens/linkplusinfo.html">LINK+</a>):</p> <figure><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ebruchez/public/master/Blog%20posts/images/2013-09-30-organ-700.jpg" alt="The Organ from its Invention in the Hellenistic Period to the end of the Thirteenth Century" id="main-image" class="responsive-image" /><figcaption>The Organ from its Invention in the Hellenistic Period to the end of the Thirteenth Century</figcaption></figure>   <p>I just read the introduction and seems like it is well-written and very well-researched - a true scholarly work, in a good way. The only problem is that this brick is about 300 pages long! What are the chances that I will go through it?</p> <p>So here&#8217;s my plan: for the month of October, I will try to read on average 10 pages of the book per day. The idea is to try to read at least a few pages every day. It would be unsustainable to have to read a hundred pages on a Sunday evening.</p> <p>The goal is not to finish the book, but to learn something useful for my project. This mean serious reading, including taking notes. I will allow for exceptions, for example if it turns out that parts of the book are not needed for my research, or if it turns out that, after all, the book turns out to be boring.</p> <p>Finally, but optionally, I might tweet things I learn.</p> <p><strong>Update:</strong> My reading notes are <a href="https://github.com/ebruchez/public/blob/master/Reading/2013-10%20-%20The%20Organ.md">here</a>.</p>
