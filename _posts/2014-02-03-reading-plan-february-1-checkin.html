<p>This is my February 1 checkin following my <a href="http://blog.bruchez.name/2014/01/books-i-plan-to-read-in-2014.html">Books I plan to read in 2014</a> post.</p> <p>January was a short month as I posted my resolution on January 20 only.</p> <p>The good news is that I have finished <a href="http://blog.bruchez.name/2013/09/october-reading-resolution.html">The Organ from its Invention in the Hellenistic Period to the end of the Thirteenth Century</a> by Jean Perrot. This has kept me busy (or in the back of my head) for about 4 months! I have pretty complete <a href="https://github.com/ebruchez/public/blob/master/Reading/2013-10%20-%20The%20Organ.md">reading notes</a>.</p> <p>While technically &#8220;reading the book&#8221; is done, I would like to write a synthesis of what I have learned.</p> <p>So my goals for February are:</p> <ul><li>write that synthesis</li><li>pick the next book to read and start in February</li></ul> <p>I am shooting for 10 serious reading days this month, for a total of 5 hours.</p>
