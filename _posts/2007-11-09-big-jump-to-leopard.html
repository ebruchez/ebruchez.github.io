Last night, I figured (completely irrationally) that I would take the jump and upgrade to Leopard. Here is my first feedback after one day of work with it:<br /><ul><li>I got the infamous "blue screen" upon restart during install. I followed <a href="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=306857">option C</a> and luckily thing went smoothly after that. I don't know yet which app installed <tt>ApplicationEnhancer.bundle</tt>.</li><li>As I already knew, Java windows don't play nice with <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/spaces.html">Spaces</a>. All the Java apps remain stubbornly in the first space and won't move. Also, if you are in a space other than the first one and cmd-tab to a Java app, nothing happens: you have to explicitly go back to the space containing the Java app. It's not a showstopper, but it should be fixed.</li><li><a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ</a> has some random problems with the tabs in the files section: they sometimes, <a href="http://www.jetbrains.net/jira/browse/IDEA-16084">behave erratically</a>. This is annoying and I hope that IntelliJ >= 7.0.2 will fix this. It seem that changing look and feel may work around the issue, but IntelliJ then looks utterly ugly.<br /></li><li><a href="http://www.parallels.com/">Parallels</a> seems to run fine, except that Windows drives don't show up in the Finder.</li><li>I had no immediate obvious issues with Firefox, Thunderbird, or Tomcat.</li></ul>So I can't really say "so far so good", but it seems like things should be workable.
