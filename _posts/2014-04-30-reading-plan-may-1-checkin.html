<p>My <a href="http://blog.bruchez.name/2014/03/reading-plan-march-1-checkin.html">goals for the end of March</a> were:</p> <ul><li>3 quality hours of reading</li><li>complete synthesis of the organ book</li><li>pick the next book to read and start in March</li></ul> <p>In March, I did spend 2 hours out of the 3 planned, but that wasn&#8217;t quite enough to complete the synthesis, and I haven&#8217;t picked the next book yet.</p> <p>In April, I completely dropped the ball: I missed the April 1 checkin and didn&#8217;t do anything related to my reading plan during the month.</p> <p>I had scheduled 1/2 hour on the reading plan each Wednesday and Thursday afternoon. But I found myself &#8220;too busy&#8221; or too guilty to take that time off work. Yet it&#8217;s too difficult to find quality time late in the evening.</p> <p>So for May, let&#8217;s try to get back on the wagon and to do 3 hours spread over the whole month. Otherwise, same goals: complete the synthesis, and pick the next book.</p>
