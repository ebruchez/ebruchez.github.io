At home, I am now using the Apple Bluetooth keyboard and mouse, and I am quite happy with them.<br /><br />Recently, I thought I would look at getting a Bluetooth headphone, especially since the advanced audio profile (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A2DP#Advanced_Audio_Distribution_Profile_.28A2DP.29">A2DP</a>) seems to be getting more widespread, and OS X Leopard finally added support for it. It is just so appealing to go cordless.<br /><br />So I ordered the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Motorola-MOTOROKR-Bluetooth-Headphones-Packaging/dp/B000NKCO5Q">Motorola MOTOROKR S9</a>, which had pretty good reviews, and I connected it to my MacBook Pro. Here are the major issues I encountered:<br /><ul><li>Even when no music is playing, there is a constant background noise. If you adjust the volume optimally and play pop music, you may not notice it so much, but this pretty much kills classical music.</li><li>Interferences, which translate with pops and cracks, come up every few seconds or tens of seconds. I tried distances between the headphone and the computer of maybe two to then feet, with the same result.<br /></li><li>Background noise and interferences aside, the sound quality is metallic and full of artifacts which remind me of the first mp3 encoders back in the 90s. I guess that this may be due to the use of the low complexity SBC codec instead of decent compression on the wire.</li><li>Using the headphone or headset along with a Bluetooth mouse simply doesn't work: the mouse will stop to a crawl.</li><li>I got a complete OS crash (kernel panic) in the OS X A2DP driver. This actually happened after my headset was already shipped back.</li></ul>The above I think fully justifies my sending the S9 back to Amazon. There are also smaller issues:<br /><ul><li>I got into situations where no sound would come out at all when playing from iTunes, and I simply couldn't get things back to work without pairing the device again.</li><li>I couldn't get Skype to use the headset microphone as input, but the high-quality A2DP as output.</li><li>As a headset, the sound only comes out on the left side.</li></ul>In short I am utterly disappointed because I thought that by now the technology would be ready, and it turns out that there is a lot going on for the S9:<br /><ul><li>It really looks cool and is almost invisible from the front</li><li>The sound quality of the earbuds themselves seems decent<br /></li><li>It is comfortable and lightweight</li><li>As a headset connected to an iPhone, it seemed to work quite well<br /></li></ul>Hopefully the manufacturers will soon figure out how to really make this work. As it is today, I simply think that it is not useable, certainly not with a Mac.
