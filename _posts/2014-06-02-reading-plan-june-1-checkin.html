<p>My <a href="http://blog.bruchez.name/2014/04/reading-plan-may-1-checkin.html">goals for the month of May</a> were:</p> <ul><li>3 quality hours of reading</li><li>complete synthesis of the organ book</li><li>pick the next book to read and start</li></ul> <p>I did manage to do a bit more than 3 hours of planned reading, so that&#8217;s a success! Now &#8220;reading&#8221; is a bit of a misnomer because all of this time was spent working on the synthesis. But that was not enough to complete it, so the success is only partial.</p> <p>Surely, 3 more hours in June should allow me to complete the synthesis this time? Ok, that&#8217;s the plan.</p>
