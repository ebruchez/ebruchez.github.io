But Leopard adds even more to the mix:<br /><ul><li>The new Quick Look feature in the Finder and Mail is not perfect, but excellent nonetheless: just press the space bar (Finder) or a button (Mail) and you have a super-fast preview of almost any document or attachment, including PDF. You can even scroll down multi-page documents and keep the preview open while navigating to other documents. (To be fair, OS X should have had this for years but better late than never.)</li><li>The new Preview allows you to insert, delete, rotate, and reorganize pages in a PDF document and save the result.</li><li>The much improved Spotlight automatically indexes PDF documents for (almost) instant content search.</li></ul>Windows XP has nothing of the sort built-in. Vista has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_Paper_Specification">XPS</a>, which sounds cool but, no matter how good it may be, is today nowhere as widespread as PDF and that alone does not make it a viable option for me at the moment. Leopard definitely wins this one.
