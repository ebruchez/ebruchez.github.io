<p>At the beginning of October, I <a href="http://blog.bruchez.name/2013/09/october-reading-resolution.html">wrote</a> about my reading resolution for that month. So, how did I do?</p> <p>First, the numbers:</p> <ul><li>I hit 16 reading days out of 31.</li><li>I read on average 10 pages each reading day.</li><li>I read 170 out of about 300 pages.</li><li>To read 10 pages well and take notes, I needed 30&#8211;40 minutes, rarely less.</li></ul> <p>The bad:</p> <ul><li>I didn&#8217;t manage to read every day. I quickly figured out that it was almost impossible to read on the weekends, but even considering only weekdays, I still fell short with 16 out of 23 weekdays.</li><li>I didn&#8217;t reach 10 pages per day on average, which would have allowed me to finish the book. This is not surprising, as I would have had to read about double the number of page per reading day, given the reduction in reading days.</li></ul> <p>The good:</p> <ul><li>I did make great progress.</li><li>I have <a href="https://github.com/ebruchez/public/blob/master/Reading/2013-10%20-%20The%20Organ.md">reading notes</a> on github.</li><li>I learned about my effective &#8220;slow reading&#8221; speed.</li><li>I plan to continue this in November, with the differences that I will plan to read only on weekdays. I still plan to average 10 pages per reading day and to take notes. The plan is to finish the book by the end of November. Let&#8217;s see how that goes!</li></ul> <p>See also my Rabbit Rabbit Resolution Accountability Squad <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/rabbit-rabbit/GP3ytgmcOes/B-JQxWJitmAJ">checkin</a> for this month.</p> <p><em>Update: It turns out I have to return the book to the library on November 7 as I can only extend it once. I ordered a used copy but that will arrive only in about a week if all goes well. So that will induce some delay.</em></p>
