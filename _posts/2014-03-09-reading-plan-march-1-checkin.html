<p>At <a href="http://blog.bruchez.name/2014/02/reading-plan-february-1-checkin.html">last month&#8217;s checkin</a>, I had the following goals:</p> <ul><li>complete my quick synthesis of the organ book</li><li>pick the next book to read and start in February</li><li>spend about 5 hours in total</li></ul> <p>I failed on all counts:</p> <ul><li>I did work on the synthesis but I did not complete it.</li><li>I didn&#8217;t pick and start the next book.</li><li>I spent a total of about 1 1/2 hour,</li></ul> <p>So far this month I haven&#8217;t done any progress at all, and 2/3 of the month are left. Let&#8217;s plan to do only 3 quality hours of reading, with the same goals as last month otherwise. This time I am scheduling the reading time in advance.</p>
