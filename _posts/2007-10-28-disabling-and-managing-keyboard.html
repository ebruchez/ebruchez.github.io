Not a minute is spent at work without it running, and more and more I am using it for personal tasks as well.<br /><br />I run the Timer in the Firefox sidebar. However, I have countless times used by mistake the cmd-B (or ctrl-B for non-Mac users) combination, which opens the bookmarks in the sidebar. There goes my timer: I have to reopen it and restart my current task. This is even more annoying as I don't use Firefox bookmarks but <a href="http://del.icio.us/ebruchez/">del.icio.us</a> instead.<br /><br />The good news is that I found the <a href="http://kb.mozillazine.org/Keyconfig_extension">Keyconfig</a> extension for Firefox (and Thunderbird) which allows you to easily edit Firefox keyboard shortcuts. Install, go to Tools -> Keyconfig, and get rid of the cmd-B binding (or assign it to something more useful). Note that I <a href="http://extensionroom.mozdev.org/more-info/keyconfig">downloaded Keyconfig from here</a>.
