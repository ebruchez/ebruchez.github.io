[Why Are Dead People Liking Stuff On Facebook?](https://readwrite.com/2012/12/11/why-are-dead-people-liking-stuff-on-facebook)

> If Facebook canâ€™t get this under control, what does that say about the value of its data? The persistence of these fake likes is an unnerving thing for Facebook users and investors alike.

I saw at least a couple such impossible "likes" in my Facebook News Feed. I agree that this kind of things are not helping Facebook.

The Facebook mobile app also has those things called "Suggested Posts". Here is an example of what I see:

- "Have your favorite songs played at parties with RequestNow"
- "LIKE and SHARE this look inside The Bridge and discover the chilling secrets behind FX's newest drama"
- "Experience a night under the starry African sky"
- Ad for Doctor who t-shirts
- Eagle Club Indoor Golf
- Ad for a Windows 8 Dell tablet

I would say 3 out of 6 kind of relate to my interests, although I am very unlikely to buy a t-shirt, book a trip to Africa, or buy a Windows tablet based on this kind of sponsorships. Overall, based on this little sample, those suggested posts are mostly annoying noise.

I wonder if the system is able to learn. Also, what if they only showed me a quarter, or a tenth of those "Suggested Posts", but better targeted? What if Facebook erred on the side of quality rather than quantity?
