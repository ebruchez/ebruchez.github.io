But you can&#8217;t change it, unless you have it&#8221;.</p> <p>I like what <a href="https://twitter.com/buster">@buster</a> says about sharing resolutions &#8220;<a href="https://medium.com/buster-benson/69cda443d387">so that the information is &#8220;out there&#8221; and can&#8217;t be easily brushed away</a>&#8221;, and doing his &#8220;<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/rabbit-rabbit">rabbit rabbit</a>&#8221; checkins in 2013 helped follow my resolutions over the year.</p> <p>So here it is: in 2014, in addition to finishing the last 20 pages of <a href="http://blog.bruchez.name/2013/09/october-reading-resolution.html"><em>The Organ from its Invention in the Hellenistic Period to the end of the Thirteenth Century</em></a>, I plan to read or finish reading one book in each of the following categories:</p> <ul><li>serious  <ul><li>history</li><li>science</li><li>philosophy</li><li>biography</li><li>music</li></ul></li><li>less serious  <ul><li>French</li><li>fiction</li><li>science-fiction/fantasy</li></ul></li></ul> <p>My concrete selection in the &#8220;serious&#8221; categories is:</p> <ul><li><strong>History:</strong> John King Fairbank&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Great-Chinese-Revolution-1800-1985/dp/006039076X"><em>The Great Chinese Revolution</em></a>: this is a book which I started years ago but haven&#8217;t finished. But I find the history of China starting around 1800 fascinating, and the West is almost fully ignorant of it.</li><li><strong>Science:</strong> Richard Dawkins&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Selfish-Gene-Edition---Introduction/dp/0199291152/"><em>The Selfish Gene</em></a>: I purchased this book in 2007, read a few pages, and that was it.</li><li><strong>Philosophy:</strong> Daniel Dennett&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Intuition-Pumps-Other-Tools-Thinking/dp/0393082067/"><em>Intuition Pumps And Other Tools for Thinking</em></a>: I read the sample chapter, which was pretty good.</li><li><strong>Biography:</strong> Walter Isaacson&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Steve-Jobs-Walter-Isaacson/dp/1451648537/"><em>Steve Jobs</em></a>: I even had this book on preorder when it came out and read one chapter. Time to finish it!</li><li><strong>Music:</strong> Possibly my friend Cesare Orselli&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Pietro-Mascagni-Cesare-Orselli/dp/8883024001"><em>Pietro Mascagni</em></a> (in Italian, which makes it more of a challenge).</li></ul> <p>I plan to take notes for at least 3 of those books.</p> <p>In the &#8220;less serious&#8221; category, I might decide to finish Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Terre-Hommes-French-Edition-Folio/dp/2070360210"><em>Terre des Hommes</em></a>, of which I have read a few pages already. I don&#8217;t have picks for fiction and science-fiction/fantasy yet, but that shouldn&#8217;t be too challenging.</p> <p>I am open to reading suggestions, and here are some additional candidates I have considered:</p> <ul><li>Siddhartha Mukherjee - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Emperor-All-Maladies-Biography/dp/1439170916"><em>The Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancer</em></a></li><li>Richard Dawkins - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/An-Appetite-Wonder-Making-Scientist/dp/0062225790"><em>An Appetite for Wonder: The Making of a Scientist</em></a></li><li>Steven Pinker - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Better-Angels-Our-Nature/dp/1455883115"><em>The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined</em></a></li></ul> <p>This program is very ambitious given my past record. It is possible based on <a href="http://blog.bruchez.name/2013/11/reading-resolution-update.html">my experience with one book</a> to read about 150 pages/month of a serious book while taking notes. Since the serious books have over 300 pages each, they might require more than 2 months each. So the schedule might be tight, even though I might find that some books read faster than others, and that I might not take notes for all books.</p> <p>Finally, I do plan to checkin every month (the &#8220;rabbit rabbit&#8221; trick) on <a href="https://twitter.com/ebruchez">Twitter</a>, mentioning two friends, and I have setup a double reminder to do this.</p>
