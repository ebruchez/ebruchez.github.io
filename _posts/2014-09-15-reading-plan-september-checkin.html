<p>My <a href="http://blog.bruchez.name/2014/07/reading-plan-july-checkin.html">goal for the month of July</a> was:</p> <ul><li>continue on the synthesis and try to have a closure on it, spending about 2 more hours</li></ul> <p>I didn&#8217;t have any goals for August.</p> <p>I only managed to spend another hour in July, and I don&#8217;t have a closure. So I have decided to park this work for a while.</p> <p>The good news is that I have just started reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Intuition-Pumps-Other-Tools-Thinking/dp/1491518871"><em>Daniel Dennett&#8217;s Intuition Pumps and Other Tools for Thinking</em></a> this month, one of the books on my <a href="http://blog.bruchez.name/2014/01/books-i-plan-to-read-in-2014.html">reading plan for 2014</a>.</p> <p>I have decided to read this book not in digital format, but on good old paper. I have also decided to allow myself to trash this book with highlights and annotations as I see fit.</p> <p>My goal for the rest of the month is simply to make progress reading this book.</p>
