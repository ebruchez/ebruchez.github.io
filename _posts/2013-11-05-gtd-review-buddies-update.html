<p>About a month and a half ago, at the end of September, I <a href="http://blog.bruchez.name/2013/09/gtd-review-buddies.html">wrote</a> about setting up a &#8220;GTD review buddy system&#8221; with <a href="https://twitter.com/avernet">Alex</a>. I can report that it went pretty well:</p> <ul><li>Alex and I did 7 GTD review sessions, always on Monday at approximately 10 pm.</li><li>In my case, each review session lasted at least 30 minutes, and sometimes close to an hour. Yes, I have really a big backlog to process!</li><li>Yesterday, for the first time in maybe years, I managed to get down to zero items in my <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus">OmniFocus</a> inbox, and to only about 20 items in my e-mail inbox, consisting mainly of really old items that I still need to sort through. <a href="http://inboxzero.com/">&#8220;Inbox zero&#8221;</a> is near!</li><li>I have made good progress on reviewing and organizing my work-related projects. I am maybe about 3/4 through.</li></ul> <p>I still need to review all my personal projects, a task that I haven&#8217;t started yet. I may or may not manage to be done reviewing all my project by the end of this year, but at this rate I should be pretty close. If everything goes well, I will be done catching up in early 2014, and then start doing regular GTD reviews, which should be much shorter.</p>
