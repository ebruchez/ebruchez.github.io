Here is how it went:<br /><ul><li>Setup <a href="https://mv.dmv.ca.gov/foAppt2/welcome.do">appointment</a> at the San Mateo <a href="http://www.dmv.ca.gov/">DMV</a> with their online form (if you don't get an appointment, you will wait longer on-site)</li><li>At the DMV:</li><ul><li>"Start here" counter: got number and a form (nobody was in line)</li></ul><ul><li>Waiting area: filled out renewal form and worked on my laptop while waiting for my number (took about 15 minutes for my number to be called)</li></ul><ul><li>Counter 1: gave filled-out form, paid fee (USD 20-something) with credit card, got receipt</li><li>Counter 2: waited a bit in line, got picture taken and renewal test</li><li>Testing area: filled out test as best as I could (last time I actually studied the stuff was 10 years ago)</li><li>Counter 3: waited a bit in line, produced filled-out test (yay I passed) and got my temp license</li></ul><li>One week later: got the actual license in the mail</li></ul>The positives:<br /><ul><li>The appointment + number system works fine.</li><li>The DMV employees are efficient.</li><li>I was done in about one hour total at the DMV.</li><li>I feared I would need a drive test but luckily that was not needed.</li><li>I was not asked for a proof of residence. My SSN and expired license seemed to be enough.</li></ul>Of course all this could be streamlined even more with appropriate technology. You still spend more time than necessary waiting in line. So always take with you a computer / music player / book or whatever can be used to fill in the gaps.
