(The following is inspired by my brother's [2012 en chiffres](https://bruchez.blogspot.ch/2013_01_01_archive.html) and [2013 en chiffres](http://bruchez.blogspot.com/2014/01/2013-en-chiffres.html) "year in numbers" posts, with some twists!)

## In 2013, we had 1 baby

The first defining moment of 2013 for our family was the birth of our second son in February. He is now 11-month-old and thriving.

## In 2013, I lost 1 grandfather

The second defining moment of the year was the passing away of my grandfather. With this I have now lost all my grandparents. I should be grateful that he lived to the age of 92 with a good quality of life. Yet I agree with Ray Kurzweil, who views death in general as "a tragedy": it is the loss of a person, of a mind, of memories, for which there is no proper "backup".

## In 2013, I took 2 trips to Switzerland

The first one was in June for the funeral. I am glad I took that short trip to share this with my family. The second one was in December/January for a family vacation. These are my only two trips by air this year. I don't miss the days where I travelled so much for business!

## In 2013, we sold 1 car

We sold my wife's 1999 Miata, for which we didn't have much use anymore with 2 kids. It was pretty easy to sell it, as it was in pretty good condition and, I was told, a used Miata was the car to have this summer in the Bay Area!

## In 2013, I voluntarily fasted 4 days

During the month of April, I decided to try to fast once per week as an experiment, to see what it would feel like. The rule: no solid food from the time I went to bed the day before until the morning the day after. It was a bit painful at times but it turned out to be doable, if a bit unpleasant. I did allow myself a fruit juice during the day. The day after fasting, however, I felt hungry a good part of the day even with regular-size meals.

## In 2013, we had a lot of family visiting

After the birth, we had visits and help from family both from Taiwan and Switzerland. I am grateful for this, as that allowed us to deal with the work and tiredness that come with a new child.

## In 2013, I posted 44 work blog posts

I posted 18 of those on my [personal blog](http://blog.bruchez.name/):

- 2 on Scala.
- 5 on personal topics.
- 11 short "link blog" style.

And I posted 26 of those on the [Orbeon blog](http://blog.orbeon.com/).

## In 2013, my weight oscillated 10 lbs

That's too much to my taste. The minimum was in March and the maximum in October. I have been fed too well, and I have been too lazy! I think that lack of sleep and exercise, and stress due to the second child didn't help.

## In 2013, I went to the gym 23 times and took at least 7 small hikes

In short: not enough.

## In 2013, I posted 1,294 tweets and sent 2,201 emails

That's 209 more tweets than in 2012.

## In 2013, I watched 8 movies, 2 documentaries, and watched 3 series

That's not a lot, but we've had other things to do. None were at the movie theater. The series are:

- The Big Bang Theory
- Doctor Who
- Les Mystérieuses Cités d'or (1982-1983)

See also my [list of latest movies](https://pinboard.in/u:ebruchez/t:movies+watched).

## In 2013, I read or listened to 10 books or audiobooks

I even include my organ book in this count, which technically I finished in 2014. Of these:

- 5 were "serious" reads
- 5 were audiobooks
- 4 were rereads
- 2 were science fiction

See also my [list of latest reads](https://github.com/ebruchez/public/blob/master/Books.md#read).

## In 2013, I had 7 colds

This looks like a lot, retrospectively:

- February 3 (I wrote "mild", but this was followed by weeks of coughing)
- April 6
- April 23
- August 11
- October 15
- November 11
- December 17 (with coughing)
