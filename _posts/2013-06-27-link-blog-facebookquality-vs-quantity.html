<a href="http://readwrite.com/2012/12/11/why-are-dead-people-liking-stuff-on-facebook#awesm=~oa2fm6Eg0Wh0w4">Why Are Dead People Liking Stuff On Facebook?</a><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">If Facebook canâ€™t get this under control, what does that say about the value of its data? The persistence of these fake likes is an unnerving thing for Facebook users and investors alike.</blockquote>I saw at least a couple such impossible "likes" in my Facebook News Feed. I agree that this kind of things are not helping Facebook.<br /><br />The Facebook mobile app also has those things called "Suggested Posts". Here is an example of what I see:<br /><ul><li>"Have your favorite songs played at parties with RequestNow"</li><li>"LIKE and SHARE this look inside The Bridge and discover the chilling secrets behind FX's newest drama"</li><li>"Experience a night under the starry African sky"</li><li>Ad for Doctor who t-shirts</li><li>Eagle Club Indoor Golf</li><li>Ad for a Windows 8 Dell tablet</li></ul><div>I would say 3 out of 6 kind of relate to my interests, although I am very unlikely to buy a t-shirt, book a trip to Africa, or buy a Windows tablet based on this kind of sponsorships. Overall, based on this little sample, those suggested posts are mostly annoying noise.<br /><br />I wonder if the system is able to learn. Also, what if they only showed me a quarter, or a tenth of those "Suggested Posts", but better targeted? What if Facebook erred on the side of quality rather than quantity?</div><div><br /></div>
