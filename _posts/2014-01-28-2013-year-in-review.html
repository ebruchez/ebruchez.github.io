<p>(The following is inspired by my brother&#8217;s <a href="http://bruchez.blogspot.ch/2013_01_01_archive.html">2012 en chiffres</a> and <a href="http://bruchez.blogspot.com/2014/01/2013-en-chiffres.html">2013 en chiffres</a> &#8220;year in numbers&#8221; posts, with some twists!)</p> <h3 id="in2013wehad1baby">In 2013, we had 1 baby</h3> <p>The first defining moment of 2013 for our family was the birth of our second son in February. He is now 11-month-old and thriving.</p> <figure><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ebruchez/public/master/Blog%20posts/images/2014-01-28-yoann-700.jpg" alt="Number 2 and his grandfather" id="yoann-image" class="responsive-image" /><figcaption>Number 2 and his grandfather</figcaption></figure>   <h3 id="in2013ilost1grandfather">In 2013, I lost 1 grandfather</h3> <p>The second defining moment of the year was the passing away of my grandfather. With this I have now lost all my grandparents. I should be grateful that he lived to the age of 92 with a good quality of life. Yet I agree with Ray Kurzweil, who views death in general as &#8220;a tragedy&#8221;: it is the loss of a person, of a mind, of memories, for which there is no proper &#8220;backup&#8221;.</p> <figure><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ebruchez/public/master/Blog%20posts/images/2014-01-28-grandfather-700.jpg" alt="Number 1 and his great-grandfather in 2012" id="grandfather-image" class="responsive-image" /><figcaption>Number 1 and his great-grandfather in 2012</figcaption></figure>   <h3 id="in2013itook2tripstoswitzerland">In 2013, I took 2 trips to Switzerland</h3> <p>The first one was in June for the funeral. I am glad I took that short trip to share this with my family. The second one was in December/January for a family vacation. These are my only two trips by air this year. I don&#8217;t miss the days where I travelled so much for business!</p> <figure><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ebruchez/public/master/Blog%20posts/images/2014-01-28-switzerland-700.jpg" alt="" id="switzerland-image" class="responsive-image" /></figure>   <h3 id="in2013wesold1car">In 2013, we sold 1 car</h3> <p>We sold my wife&#8217;s 1999 Miata, for which we didn&#8217;t have much use anymore with 2 kids. It was pretty easy to sell it, as it was in pretty good condition and, I was told, a used Miata was the car to have this summer in the Bay Area!</p> <figure><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ebruchez/public/master/Blog%20posts/images/2014-01-28-miata-700.jpg" alt="" id="miata-image" class="responsive-image" /></figure>   <h3 id="in2013ivoluntarilyfasted4days">In 2013, I voluntarily fasted 4 days</h3> <p>During the month of April, I decided to try to fast once per week as an experiment, to see what it would feel like. The rule: no solid food from the time I went to bed the day before until the morning the day after. It was a bit painful at times but it turned out to be doable, if a bit unpleasant. I did allow myself a fruit juice during the day. The day after fasting, however, I felt hungry a good part of the day even with regular-size meals.</p> <h3 id="in2013wehadalotoffamilyvisiting">In 2013, we had a lot of family visiting</h3> <p>After the birth, we had visits and help from family both from Taiwan and Switzerland. I am grateful for this, as that allowed us to deal with the work and tiredness that come with a new child.</p> <h3 id="in2013iposted44workblogposts">In 2013, I posted 44 work blog posts</h3> <p>I posted 18 of those on my <a href="http://blog.bruchez.name/">personal blog</a>:</p> <ul><li>2 on Scala.</li><li>5 on personal topics.</li><li>11 short &#8220;link blog&#8221; style.</li></ul> <p>And I posted 26 of those on the <a href="http://blog.orbeon.com/">Orbeon blog</a>.</p> <h3 id="in2013myweightoscillated10lbs">In 2013, my weight oscillated 10 lbs</h3> <p>That&#8217;s too much to my taste. The minimum was in March and the maximum in October. I have been fed too well, and I have been too lazy! I think that lack of sleep and exercise, and stress due to the second child didn&#8217;t help.</p> <h3 id="in2013iwenttothegym23timesandtookatleast7smallhikes">In 2013, I went to the gym 23 times and took at least 7 small hikes</h3> <p>In short: not enough.</p> <h3 id="in2013iposted1294tweetsandsent2201emails">In 2013, I posted 1,294 tweets and sent 2,201 emails</h3> <p>That&#8217;s 209 more tweets than in 2012.</p> <h3 id="in2013iwatched8movies2documentariesandwatched3series">In 2013, I watched 8 movies, 2 documentaries, and watched 3 series</h3> <p>That&#8217;s not a lot, but we&#8217;ve had other things to do. None were at the movie theater. The series are:</p> <ul><li>The Big Bang Theory</li><li>Doctor Who</li><li>Les Mystérieuses Cités d&#8217;or (1982&#8211;1983)</li></ul> <p>See also my <a href="https://pinboard.in/u:ebruchez/t:movies+watched">list of latest movies</a>.</p> <h3 id="in2013ireadorlistenedto10booksoraudiobooks">In 2013, I read or listened to 10 books or audiobooks</h3> <p>I even include my organ book in this count, which technically I finished in 2014. Of these:</p> <ul><li>5 were &#8220;serious&#8221; reads</li><li>5 were audiobooks</li><li>4 were rereads</li><li>2 were science fiction</li></ul> <p>See also my <a href="https://github.com/ebruchez/public/blob/master/Books.md#read">list of latest reads</a>.</p> <h3 id="in2013ihad7colds">In 2013, I had 7 colds</h3> <p>This looks like a lot, retrospectively:</p> <ul><li>February 3 (I wrote &#8220;mild&#8221;, but this was followed by weeks of coughing)</li><li>April 6</li><li>April 23</li><li>August 11</li><li>October 15</li><li>November 11</li><li>December 17 (with coughing)</li></ul>
