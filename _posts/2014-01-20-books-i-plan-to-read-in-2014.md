As [Randy Pausch said][1], "Yes, you are going to have to change the plan. But you can't change it, unless you have it".

I like what [@buster][2]  says about sharing resolutions "[so that the information is "out there" and can't be easily brushed away][3]", and doing his "[rabbit rabbit][4]" checkins in 2013 helped follow my resolutions over the year.

So here it is: in 2014, in addition to finishing the last 20 pages of [*The Organ from its Invention in the Hellenistic Period to the end of the Thirteenth Century*][5], I plan to read or finish reading one book in each of the following categories:

- serious
    - history
    - science
    - philosophy
    - biography
    - music
- less serious
    - French
    - fiction
    - science-fiction/fantasy

My concrete selection in the "serious" categories is:

- __History:__ John King Fairbank's [*The Great Chinese Revolution*](http://www.amazon.com/The-Great-Chinese-Revolution-1800-1985/dp/006039076X): this is a book which I started years ago but haven't finished. But I find the history of China starting around 1800 fascinating, and the West is almost fully ignorant of it.
- __Science:__ Richard Dawkins's [*The Selfish Gene*](http://www.amazon.com/The-Selfish-Gene-Edition---Introduction/dp/0199291152/): I purchased this book in 2007, read a few pages, and that was it.
- __Philosophy:__ Daniel Dennett's [*Intuition Pumps And Other Tools for Thinking*](http://www.amazon.com/Intuition-Pumps-Other-Tools-Thinking/dp/0393082067/): I read the sample chapter, which was pretty good.
- __Biography:__ Walter Isaacson's [*Steve Jobs*](http://www.amazon.com/Steve-Jobs-Walter-Isaacson/dp/1451648537/): I even had this book on preorder when it came out and read one chapter. Time to finish it!
- __Music:__ Possibly my friend Cesare Orselli's [*Pietro Mascagni*](http://www.amazon.com/Pietro-Mascagni-Cesare-Orselli/dp/8883024001) (in Italian, which makes it more of a challenge).

I plan to take notes for at least 3 of those books.

In the "less serious" category, I might decide to finish Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry's [*Terre des Hommes*][6], of which I have read a few pages already. I don't have picks for fiction and science-fiction/fantasy yet, but that shouldn't be too challenging.

I am open to reading suggestions, and here are some additional candidates I have considered:

- Siddhartha Mukherjee  - [*The Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancer*](http://www.amazon.com/The-Emperor-All-Maladies-Biography/dp/1439170916)
- Richard Dawkins - [*An Appetite for Wonder: The Making of a Scientist*](http://www.amazon.com/An-Appetite-Wonder-Making-Scientist/dp/0062225790)
- Steven Pinker - [*The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined*](http://www.amazon.com/The-Better-Angels-Our-Nature/dp/1455883115)

This program is very ambitious given my past record. It is possible based on [my experience with one book][7] to read about 150 pages/month of a serious book while taking notes. Since the serious books have over 300 pages each, they might require more than 2 months each. So the schedule might be tight, even though I might find that some books read faster than others, and that I might not take notes for all books.

Finally, I do plan to checkin every month (the "rabbit rabbit" trick) on [Twitter][8], mentioning two friends, and I have setup a double reminder to do this.
